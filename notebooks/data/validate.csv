"The photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides, and just below her hair, there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat- well, it's not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl. i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing. the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater. bummer. i'll be returning it.",1
"Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four, i am moderately short waisted.",4
I ove the interesting details on this pullover. it is super cozy on and i love the arched hem and extra long cuffs. the crew neck is wide and comfortable but not so wide that you need another shirt underneath. great easy pullover with jeans or leggings.,4
"This skirt is very comfortable and moves well. i'm 5'4"" and ordered a 2p, which fits perfectly. the length hits just above the top of my feet. the patterned chiffon is sheer and the skirt has a short black slip underneath that ends just above my knees. i have a small waist and wider hips, but found the inner slip to fit loosely enough so that it doesn't ride up when i walk or sit. the two slits on either side were a great length and make this skirt both flirty and quirky. you'll get tons of comp",4
"I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.",4
So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.,4
"This is a really great tunic. purchased it in black and it is very flattering. i love the side slit detail. the material may seem very casual, but it is extremely comfortable and can be dressed up. i'm 5'3"" 130lbs and a s fits perfect.",4
"I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish, soft and very comfortable.",4
"With all the white dresses to choose from this year, this was the one i settled on. it is comfortable, the quality is good, especially in the edge detail, it's machine washable (which is a must for me and white), and it is easy to dress up or down. i am 5'7"", 125lbs and found my usual size small to fit tts - it is loose fit like the model shot. easy throw on and go dress with cute details to boot :)",4
"I like this top. in the photo, the white in the print stands out. in-person, the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull, more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good, the print looks good. it is a swing top, looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down, could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.",2
"Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. 
it's really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!",4
"This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price, i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them, go for it!",2
The online pic does not even do this beautiful blouse justice. in person it is stunning and goes with everything.,4
"I was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one! i ordered the white in a small (size 2) i am 5'4 130lbs. it fits perfect and the length is just right. some reviews said it's boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it won't be an issue! yes, it's a lace dress so it's going to be delicate and you'll need to handle with care. but it's worth it, absolutely stunning!",4
"I bought the moss, which is more of a pretty pastel green. they are very nice in that they aren't tight, yet stylish and i can dress them up. the only drawback is that they stretch a lot. i can get two wears out of them, maybe a 3rd, if not worn for hours and hours or all day each wear. i'm getting the light yellow pilcro hyphen chinos, now. all the colors of both styles in the store are very nice. i'd like to have each color. for reference - i'm 5'2"" and size 27. i would say that they are tts b",3
"I love flowers! i love flowers on my basic tees even better! simple,comfy,but different from your every day plain old tee!",4
"I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.",4
"I just received these in the mail, but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27, so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.",4
"I really like the look of the jacket and that it is stretching. sizing a bit odd. the xs is pretty snug in the arms, body is fitted. but the small seems 2 sizes larger. the body is very baggy. i kept the xs, but can't wear sleeves underneath!",3
"I was a bit concerned that the top would be too small on top, (ordered an xl) but the a line design is very flattering and it fit well. it is a biit see through, so i'll be wearing another layer underneath - personal preference.",3
"I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however, i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it's going back.",2
"I love the cut of these pants! i'm very curvy and the high waist and wide leg is perfect for me. these hang off the hips beautifully. i'm 5'2"" and the petite is perfect with heels. i didn't have to hem them. the one drawback is that they get very static clingy which is frustrating. i wear them with a cream tie blouse and wedges. they're really comfortable.",3
"I love this top so much i tried it on twice. because i forgot why it didn't work the first time: i have a chest. i'm just a c cup, but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top. if that's not an issue for you, i think you'll love it.",3
"I love the cut of this top, it flares out nicely, and is very stylish. the blue is also soft on every skin tone! even my super pale skin :-) i like that it has some detail, not just the plain chambray/denim color. the xs was nice, i didn't try petite or xxs, just bought the xs in store... you can adjust how tight the fit is by tying the top and loose is nice in this style. the length was also good. (115 lbs, 30dd chest)",4
"I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug",0
I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.,2
"I absolutely love this shirt. it's so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops, i am 5'8'', 150 lbs, athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size, definitely recommend!!",4
"I am about 5'6"", 135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small, as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging, i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped, but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up, my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine, skimming but not tight",2
"Love this top, the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great, not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well, not tight and isn't baggy, the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesn't feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight.",4
"It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.",4
"I was initially drawn to the shade of blue that these were as i was looking for a lighter late summer denim. after trying them on, i found that i did not want to take them off. they fit well and did not squeeze me anywhere. no muffin top as another reviewer noted. they are definitely a looser fit so size down. i probably could have even sized down again because i found them to stretch out after a while leaving a less flattering fit but certainly still s comfortable wear. absolutely worth a try!!",3
"Ok, so by now, we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy. i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath. it would also do well layered under something. for refernce, i am 5'7, about 120, and xs was the best fit.

but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low, and it survived just fine!",4
"I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.

when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing, i found where the beads were missing.

size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands, but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on",2
"I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!",4
This is a great cold weather alternative to a coat especially in warmer climates. it is lightweight but dense. love the color.,4
"My store had only one of these, in a size xs (i tend to be more of a s in most retailer items). it was roomy. i am 5'2, 34d, & figured a petite small would be a perfect fit. i ordered the ps, it arrived today, & is still pretty big! the sleeves (which are quite flared) are a little shorter, as is the overall length, than the regular xs, but overall the ps feels just as big, if not bigger, than the regular xs! trying to decide if i should go back for the regular xs or order the regular xxs.",3
"I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.",1
"I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures, a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.",2
I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them! they are so flattering on my hourglass shape. the flare leg balances out the hips. great quality and very comfortable. i know i will get so much wear out of these. i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly.,4
"I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much, went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin, it's super soft and just the perfect length.",4
"I love this sweater! i was nervous after reading the reviews, but ordered it anyway and i'm so glad i did. i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part-- flirty and feminine, unique but also subtle. i don't think the material is scratchy. it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts, but i wouldn't call it scratchy. it was perfectly comfortable to me. i will say that it's a little short though. i vary between a m and l, depending on the shirt (5'9, long torso, 36c",4
"So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if",4
I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i tried it on and i love it. plus it is very comfortable. i would highly recommend it!,4
"This top is great! it looks much better in person. it's still kind of a faded look but it's not as light as shown here. also, the exact location of the plaid is different on each top. it runs just a tiny bit large but i liked it loose so took my normal size. there is another fabric lining the front in a very cute print. will be a nice, loose and cool top for summer. love the tie in the back as well.",4
"Currently own this in 5 colors after originally buying one. i'm 5'10"" normally wear a medium, bought a small in this. best material and fit overall, perfect length for long torso",4
"I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however, this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering, opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.",1
"I really love the look of this sweater and it seems to be of great quality. i will say the fit is a bit odd. the sweater is on the short side but is very roomy through the neck and shoulders. i ordered a small (5'6""; 120lbs) and would change for an xs but i'm afraid it would be cropped. i'm keeping it but wish it had a more uniform fit.
really beautify workmanship though.",3
This dress is beautiful. fabric is thin but the details are perfect.,4
"It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old, i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress",3
The linen fabric is elegantly thin feels and looks lovely,4
"I ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress. the fabric is light but looks quite rich, making one want to touch the textile. the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni. oh, the dress is lined. i purchased the blue pattern, and am planning on wearing it to work on friday.",4
"Love these! i wore them today for the first time and got tons of compliments. they are comfy and sooooo cute for summer. also, fyi, they make my butt look great.",4
I love this short. i normally wear size 10 this short just bit larger than average 10 .it is not to short not to long just perfect.,4
"I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled",4
"This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down.",4
"I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined, but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.",2
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys, the 27 fits very comfortably. 

i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.",4
"Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.",4
"It is a beautiful dress,but didn't fit me.this is better for someone tall and thin.",3
"This dress is very flattering on. it fits close to the body but the layers are thick so it doesn't show too much. the material is stretchy and very cozy. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs and a 34c and the medium fit perfectly.",4
"These jeans are the best. fit perfectly, so soft, comfortable, and look great on. i am in love. i put them on and did not want to take them off. i am 5'3"" and simply love the length for me. plus in my opinion the high waist is a s dream. so comfortable and really flatter my curves. these are pricey which is my only real complaint, but they are feeling worth it as i see myself wearing these a ton and the quality seems great, so i am thinking they will last a long time. don't hesitate to buy these",4
"This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home, it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7"". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust, order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top.",1
"It jacket of the season! this bomber is absolutely perfect. not only is the embroidery beautiful, but it's super comfy as well. it's lightweight, nicely lined, and well made. i only gave it four stars for quality simply because the embroidery could get pulled and frayed if not careful. you should expect that with any silky embroidered fabric however.  i would highly recommend this jacket for any body type.",4
"This piece is a winner solely b/c of the sleeves. otherwise, it's a plain, large tee. however, the sleeves are gorgeous and so unique! had they had my size left, i would have purchased in other colors (i got pink). it runs large, so size down.",3
"This is very cute in person. i love the colors, a tiny bit brighter in person. it is very feminine, with the ruffles, but with an edge. not too foo-foo. i tried no the regular size and it was a little short even on me, i would have to wear with higher rise pants, or show some belly... no petite on this one. the size 0 fit me at 115 lbs and 30dd chest. the material is light and airy, so great for warmer days. love it but in my wish list, didn't get it yet,...though the day it showed up at my loca",4
This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.,2
"Got this in wine, very pretty and soft. but so sheer, even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.",1
I love this dress. i get so many compliments from strangers every time i where it. must buy.,4
"I ordered this online and was so excited to try it! unfortunately it didn't work for me. maybe its the style but i had issues with the fit. maybe i'm too long waisted, it just didn't seem to fall properly. i liked the fabric, loved the length, could see getting a lot of use from this. i would definitely recommend trying it on!",3
"I have a narrow face, and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.",4
Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.,2
"Bought this at sale price. pretty in person and soft / comfortable. runs really big. size down.
i got it in my usual size l, but will have to exchange for an m.",4
"Long, thin, tunic.  perfect over leggings, great for casual day but look pulled together.",4
First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it's perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price.,4
"This looks cute in the web photo, unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me.",1
I just bought this dress and love the fit. i'm pear shaped and it's very flattering! it's not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape. it's also seasonless. it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono.,4
"I bought the first one in the gold color, which i call mustard. i really love the high-low style and looks great when worn with a long necklace(s). when they went on sale, i bought two more, black and grey. i love that they are perfect for layering when it's cold, but that i can also wear them alone, in other seasons. thy ran a bit large for me, so i was able to purchase the small. i am small boned, but large in the bust. i'm also short, 5'2"", but they don't look too long, especially when i wear",4
"Love this poncho! purchased xs in gold/olive color and the length is good. i could have sized up for extra length but thought there was too much fabric in body. for reference-5'8"". slender. love the diagonal cable pattern and curved design. the sleeves are more comfortable for me pushed up a little but if left long works well and are about wrist length. the color is great for fall but could easily transition into winter.spring. the gray is a lighter gray and is nice, too, but size xs not availab",4
"I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size, because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress, and it left me puzzled.  the print was pretty, but no amount of tailoring could save it for me.  it was wearing me.  maybe it could wear three of me.  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners, by making a garment without details (no installing more time consuming zippers, buttons or snaps, and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it",1
"I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2"", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c",1
"Overall, quite good red skirt, though a little clingy material. good that it has lining. the waist is elastic. xs fits great on me (5'4"", 120lbs).",4
The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high,2
"This has lovely embroidery of good quality, and it is nicely lined in the embroidered section too. it is a very loose swingy shape, so size down.",4
I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.,2
"Like other reviewers have stated, this dress does run small on the chest. i'm 5.3"", 32c, 120lbs and size 2 fits me great. however, if my chest size had been, like 34d and up, size 2 will not fit me although i'm petite frame. so, if you have a large chest, i would recommend going 1 or 2 sizes up. if you are like myself, small bust person, then you should try your regular size and one size down to see which one fits you better. i was going to try size zero, however as soon as i tried size 2, i rea",3
"Received the jacket today -- i love it but because it has no stretch in the material it feels a little snug across the shoulders. i have long arms and it fit perfect for the length. i tried to order the next size to see how it would fit, but it was sold out! i'll keep looking for it to be back in stock.",4
"/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.",3
"I loved these pants. loved them so much that it pained me to return them. but, i used shout stain remover on them once, and it drastically faded them in the spot i used the stain remover, that i had to return them. i'm grateful to retailer for standing by their product and taking the pants back for a full refund. i'm tempted to buy them again if i can't find similar pants elsewhere (and just stay away from the stain remover). but, i'm still undecided.",2
"This dress is gorgeous! i ordered it because i was getting other things and there was free shipping., i am 5'3.5"" and abt 123 lbs. usually between an xs and s and also between reg & petite. sometimes i have to order multiple sizes to get a decent fit. i ordered a sz small petite and it's perfect. super soft, great colors, perfect length!! love it!",4
"Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my",1
"This very unique dress is exquisite and so versatile ? suitable for daytime or evening, and will look great with a cardigan and tights for year-round wear. it fits perfectly and seems true to size to me ? i?m 5?2?, about 112 pounds, and got an xs. the description says the dress can be machine washed, but with the delicate trim around the neckline, i plan to hand-wash it carefully. so happy with this purchase!",4
"Although it may not look like it takes on a shape - what a wonderfully flattering jumper. was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store -- i was unsure how the middle would appear. but it fit, wonderfully feminine, looking forward to the summer.",4
"First off, the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling, the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however, i just couldn't get past the fit issue, which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest, and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me, but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else, but i had to ret",2
"This was about to be my first retailer splurge item, but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag, these pants weren't going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back.",3
"This top is a mix of materials - a silk and more of a t shirt material. i purchased for dressier wear but the material makes it more casual. i like the sale price so i'm keeping!  size down, runs a tad loose.",3
"Nice, flowy dress... only thing is that it has the high low skirt which i think is getting outdated. beyond that, it is a cute dress.",3
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size 4 but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to 2 so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11"" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it.",4
"I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top, and really wanted to like it, however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes, but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso, so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!",2
"I love the design, that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online, but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on, please!",1
"I love the built in layers of this shirt. it looks great layered with a long sleeved shirt underneath for winter also. being a teen in the 90s, it reminds me of a little bit of grunge, but in a less brooding more classy way. if only i still had my doc martins... i find the fit to be great, slightly loose, but not baggy and the fabric feels light but not fragile.",3
"I love this dress. i am usually a size 4, but ordered this in size 0 and it fits perfect! great for any season, and can dress up or dress down. the pink is the perfect shade - i feel like i'm elle woods!",4
I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.,3
"I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot (didn't even see the reviews until now). i can wear either a small or x-small in retailer but for this top, the x-small was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me (i'm 5'4, 125 lbs, 34b). i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect. i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean it's not sheer and don't have to wear a camisole. i usually stick with the classics i",4
"These pants are so comfortable. they're very flowy, and provide so much airflow to keep you cool during hot days. i actually bought these pants for work (i'm a teacher). i like to pair them with a white top and a cardigan. the waist band is elastic, which is super nice. the only thing i would like better is if the waist line was higher. the pants come up right below my natural waist, so they're not quite as high waisted as i would like. but other than that, their silky material give them the ill",4
"I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs big
i decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs.
when i tried the blue one, xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath.
however, when i tried the beige one, xs fits me well with some room for sweater.
either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand.",4
"Love this dress. the fringe makes it so special! it's a little shorter than i anticpated - it hits me right about where it shows on the model and i am 5 2"". i love the length. can't wait to wear this.",4
"First off, let me say that i am 52 and don't often go for print jeans these days:) however, these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldn't say no. these look great cuffed for warmer temps, and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters. if you are looking for something fun and flattering, these are the ticket! i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have.",4
"This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful.",4
"I have been looking at rompers for a while but being that i'm 40, a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short. i think these are the perfect length for summer (and for me!). it's cute! i am 5'5"" and 110 pounds and i ordered the xs. i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric. if i pull the waist up, the top 1/2 balloons out a little awkwardly. but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist, it looks okay",3
"This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.",4
I can't believe this top hasn't sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn't get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim.,4
"I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and i've returned for another. i love it because you can layer it. you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke. it looks great with bright colors. yes, it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed.",4
"I saw this skirt online and had to have it. as another reviewer mentioned, the color is more of a yellowy ivory. the skirt is very pretty, but also has a very thick/heavy satin polyester lining. i don't feel like i could wear it during the summer because the thick poly lining wouldn't breathe. that was the deciding factor and sadly i'll have to return it.",3
"I'm an xl in retailer blouses, and this blouse is the same. i'm guessing women with a thin frame might size down, but i can't say for sure. i purchased the white blouse with the floral pattern. there is a narrow band on the bottom, but it isn't tight, so i didn't find it to be a problem. i usually don't like blouses with banded bottoms, but this is loose. the band does cause the blouse to blouse out a bit, but the fabric has a really nice drape to it, so it worked fine. the fabric has a gre",4
I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.,4
"This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.",3
Found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites. the materials is wonderful - feels like cashmere. i got the rust which will be an anytime-anywhere piece!. recommend highly.,4
I purchased these jeans in my regular size.  they are a slouchy slim leg that looks adorable with flats or heels.. i could have sized down but wanted the slouchy look. they are very stretchy and soft. have worn a few times and they retained thier shape...,4
As always these pilcro pants did not disappoint. i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant. i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model. there is no crotch hang like in the photo. i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming.,4
"I was looking for a dressy shirt i could wear more than a few times. i have a reunion tomorrow that i wanted to wear this to. i went into a store and saw this, i immediately thought this was the perfect shirt. i saw the price tag, and decided not to get it. i looked several other places and i kept coming back to this shirt. i think if it wasn't displayed in the store, i wouldn't have wanted it so much. it is so much more beautiful in real life. the photo doesn't do it justice. i ended up orderin",3
I need one in every color. so super soft.,4
"I've worn this top with leggings and straight leg jeans. looks great with both. it's almost like a t shirt but not as clingy and way more style. i'm 5'3, 165 and the large fit great. it hid my leftover baby belly and still looked stylish with flats or boots. only complaintbis that the armholes are cut low, so side of my bra is visible. but overall it's well worth it!",4
"I bought these to have a pair between standard fair and sexy, but these are so comfortable and gorgeous i would wear them everyday! it doesn't even feel like i am wearing anything. love these!",4
"These are awesome! classic style and quality you'd expect from ag. the mid-rise is nice for moms like me that are not interested in low-rise jeans. tts. i'm 5'8"", 135# with a curvy bottom and wear a 29, which is my normal size in ag.",4
"I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts, leggings, trousers, jeans...with a vest, jacket, or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy, it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule",4
"The sweater is prettier in person than online. great quality, tight knit, overall good purchase. however, it does run small. i would absolutely size up. i am a size 4 with a 34 c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l. i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes.
i will keep it because it's gorgeous and i'll make do with the less relaxed fit, but it doesn't look on me like it does on the model.",3
"This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans, running errands, etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon, and that's the problem i think.

i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color, hangs nicely, doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck, it was a bit l",1
This boiled wool jacket is warm and cozy. it does run a little big. i have to fold the sleeves twice! but it looks great and i got compliments immediately.,4
This top fits a bit trimmer than the summer version of this top did. the lavender color is muted and a nice fall transition color.,3
"I love this top. it is perfect fit. i am 5'3 102lbs, 32 dd. it conforms to your figure.",4
"When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatley's pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast. just loved it!! i tried my normal size 4 on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so, i tried the size 2 and it fit perfectly. i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only 34b and 116 lbs and the size 2 worked fine. it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so, the fabric and stitch",4
I purchased these in white and love them! fit my muscular thighs fine.,4
"Wasn't sure what to expect - but got this on sale, and glad i did.
it is much prettier in person. soft and silky.
great fit also - and versatile (mix and match)",4
"I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8), so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me, but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.",1
"The shirt was better than it actually looked online. the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it. it's something i can probably fix, just a little disappointed receiving in that shape.

i would recommend this top. very flattering and dressy if you want it to be.",4
I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!,1
"This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!",4
"This is a beautiful, artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously, rosie neira is a talented, london-based designer, who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning, the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8, medium top, 34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label, the flowing front drape and slightly longer back, the gorgeous knit quality and design, and the way it makes m",4
"I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.",3
"I love this dress in the photos, and like it enough to keep it--but i don't love it. it runs borderline true-to-size/slightly large. i'm 5'8"", 133 lbs, 34 b and usually wear a 6 in dresses. i ordered a sm and med. am keeping the sm. medium was way too big. my main issue is the amount of fabric in the skirt--it's a bit full. in the pics, this dress appears straight, but it's not. the higher waist and skirt's fullness gives it a more casual, youthful look, which is not what i want. but the quality",3
"I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple, but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful, rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles, but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet, so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am",4
"I love the style of this jacket! 
i will be curious to see how it holds up in the rain.
it's very well made and has cute details.
it does run large.",4
"This outfit was online for months with no review so i was skeptical to order but very glad i did as it is better in person. 
it is beautiful, high quality tommy bahama inspired suit. i am 55 so short shorts are risky even though i am a typical size 4 or 6. i took a 4 in the blazer and i am typically a high 4 or low 6 in size so i would say the blazer is very true to size. i took the size 8 in the shorts as i felt they ran small and i wanted the extra length. they ride a bit lower on my waist an",4
"I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size.",3
"I wasnt expecting this top to be so soft and comfortable and breezy! i am usually an xs petite, but based on reviews i got the regular small. it is a little loose, but the length is perfect. i am short for reference (5'2, 107 lb, 32c). the buttons gaped a very tiny bit, like a centimeter, but not to the point where any skin or bra was visible. had i got the xsp, i think the gaping would have been an issue. the arms are too baggy for my taste (length is ok though), but i fold the sleeves up at th",3
"The quality of he fabric is amazing. the thickness is perfect as to look form fitting while not too tight or thin showing any ""wrinkles."" i had been searching for a versatile turtleneck i could dress up or down a finding this was a definite win! the style is timeless and with the high quality i know this will be a staple for years to come.",4
"This piece is gorgeous in person. it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything... it is more of a coat than a sweater. i bought one for my mom, and picked one up for myself when it went on sale. it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection.",4
These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!,4
Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!,4
"I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back.",1
"I listened to the other reviewers and ordered down...silly of me! all plcro seem to run a bit large and do stretch out. i got the 25 in the lovely light grey...fit me, but too tight to be comfy. i usually wear a 25,26, or 27 in jeans depending on the style. unfortunately, there are now no more in the grey...too bad. this shouldn't happen at the beginning of the season....please please please bring them back in this great neutral color or a stone.....",3
"This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also, it is pretty lightweight, so it stays cool.",4
Ordered this jacket on line. it is picture perfect. does run a little big. thought i would take a small but i'm exchanging for xs.,3
"I love how elevenses fit and the length is awesome when i wear flats. this is one of the few brands that sometimes carries a longer 33-34"" inseam. this style is a bit shorter- however, with the lighter fabric, i wouldn't want it touching the ground. pants are breezy and i love that they are lined to the calf. call me old fashioned, but all pants should be lined! the elastic waist is nice and flat in the front and works wonderfully since my butt is larger than my waist.",4
"I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut, however, it was way too short. i am 5'6"" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it.",2
Very cute and true to size if not just a little large up top.,3
"Like previous reviewers have said, these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference, i'm 5'7"", 130 lbs, 34-27-37, and am an retailer size 4 in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants, but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6, i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares, so if you're thinking of ge",1
"I never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping, love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait. this dress though i couldn't do it, i had to have it. i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july 4th get away. get it while you can.",4
"I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo, it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an",2
"This is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you don't mind flowy cuts. the material has a nice heaviness to it, and i love the black pebbled effect. 34 d, 130 lbs fit small perfectly.",3
"I received this blouse for christmas and it is just gorgeous! it fit true to size, and goes with my whole romantic, feminine style that i have without being overly girly. not too sheer, so no need for a tank underneath, and being that it is neutral, it will go with just about everything i own! love it!",4
This sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on! so cute and perfect for transitional weather. threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room. ended up with both!,4
"I am 5'5"" normally about 120lb, but i'm about 145lb now at 9 months prego. i purchased the small. i can't resist buying retailer clothes, even though they might not fit me currently! however, because this shirt is drapey, it actually fits over my baby bump now and it will be perfect as a nursing shirt and then regular shirt later. it is so soft and great quality. will be cute dressed up for work or down with jeans!",4
"This sweater has every special element i could want .... form fitting, feminine, and attention to detail. i ordered it in turquoise, which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami. because i am petite, the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot. thank you, retailer, for another timeless addition to my collection of yours.",4
"This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it's also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said, it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference, i actually love the fit and thought it was tts, though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that's only the case for c cup a",4
"Lovely dress. the beautiful colors are exactly as shown on the website. i'm 5'2"" and it reaches about midway down my shin. i'm normally a size 0 and i ordered the x-small and it fits perfectly. definitely a keeper!",4
"Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.",4
This skirt is adorable. there is no give to it though. i usually wear a 4/6 and got the 4 and i can't gain a pound or it won't zip. it is perfect for spring and summer. i'm 5'8 135.,4
"These are great pants, have them in the green holly color",4
"Snagged this dress in store today. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it is dry clean only although i will probably attempt to home wash. it runs very large. i am usually a medium but currently nursing a baby so need large to fit the chest but i bought this dress in a small. also, it can be elegantly worn backward so the zipper is in front to provide nirsing access. i don't think anyone but you would know you are wearing it backwards. very heavy fabric which makes it drape nicel",3
"I bought a xs in black. i like the weight, texture, and thickness of this fabric. it feels like it smoothes over and holds the lines of my body in well. may be the other reviewer got a pair out of an odd batch, which could mean there are inconsistencies? i would like to see how the color and the stretch holds up with future washes. it would have gotten five stars since if it came in petitte length. but i will pick up a couple of more if it hits sale.",3
"Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips, the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition, i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.",2
"I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.",4
Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.,4
"I am in love with this tunic, i wear it with everything, jeans, leggings and just tights! super comfy, quality design. runs a bit large but i like that.",4
I love the look of this dress on the hanger in the store and in the pics on the model. but i purchased my usual size 0 in petite ( i am 5 ft 2 in.). it was very form fitting-too much for me- and had little gaps near the waist that i attributed to it being tight the hips. i exchanged it for a 2 petite and that was too large and gaped in the top and waist. for reference my measurements are 32-26-35. so i am going to deduce from my experience and the other reviews that this dress might be best sizi,3
"Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.",1
"I don't ever do ruffles - i'm a 36ddd - but these laid so nicely and the vertical ruffle is very flattering for a less than flat tummy. the knit back is so soft and makes this easy to wear. it will be easy to dress up with a necklace, blazer and dressy pants but it will go just as nicely on it's on with jeans for a casual look. if there had been the mint color in my size, i would have gotten it too!",4
"I like the design of the dress, but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress, i had expected better quality.",1
"I wasn't sure what size to get in this and how it would fit since there weren't any reviews but i ordered it in a size 10 and it fits really well. i usually get dresses in a size 8 but those flow a bit more and this on my waist (am curvy on bottom) i needed to get the 10, it sits well on my waist and i don't have to hike it up. the material is chino like so it does get a bit wrinkled but it has a nice weight and the pleats give it a pretty flow not too boxy making my hips look bigger. it has bel",3
This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.,4
Love the fabric & lace on this top. like other reviews said the arm area is tight where the lace meets the fabric which makes the fit uncomfortable. sadly this top is going back. if you have very skinny upper arms this top will fit fine.,3
"I love this top, it's design is very pretty and like nothing that i have. i think this top runs true to size, i'm usually an xs/s in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great. i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily, so while wearing it you have to be very careful!!",3
"Love this dress! it can be dressed up or down and its very comfortable. i got the ps, but could have probably fit into a pxs since the style is rather loose.",4
"Comfortable,t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too. 

i ordered the xxs p, as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me, xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress, but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis",4
"This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms, or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms, this top may not be for you.",2
"This dress is cute and the a line style is quite flattering. a few minor issues: fabric is linen not denim as the name states, petite sizing is still a little large and back zipper doesn't zip down far enough to step into so has to be pulled over head (not that big of a deal). for reference i'm 5'4, 120, 32d and i ordered a petite size 4 and it was a bit large and fell bellow my knees. will be returning for a size 2. fingers crossed!",3
"It is a pretty dress but not what i had hoped for (i ordered it online.) i like slits on sleeves but the dress doesn't fit me well, so i plan to return it.
p.s. it has pockets! :-)",3
Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections.,1
"I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model, that's how it should be when you try it on.

it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done, no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t",4
This top is too cute and shows just the right amount of skin without being overt. it can be worn on or off the shoulder and is just enough to cover a tummy without looking maternity. i can't wait for the warmer weather to get here and stay so i can wear this top more often!,4
"I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.",4
"I loved this top on the mannequin, so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10, i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well..",4
Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.,1
"I threw this into my cart online on a whim, but i'm not disappointed! and i don't even wear rompers usually. for reference, i'm 5'2 and normally a size 2, and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you're on the shorter side, i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size, as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me, and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren't",3
"Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent, colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down, worn with a number of various styles - jeans, dress pants, skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit, the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small, but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate",4
"I've received so many complements when i wear this tunic. it's so comfortable and fits great. the fabric is light and feels good against my skin. this is, by far, my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings. love, love, love this tunic/dress!!",4
I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.,3
Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!,2
"Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price, i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms, but they are good enough.",4
I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.,4
I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.,1
"It's a lovely and unexpected sweater. a few things to keep in mind- 

- the knit details are beautiful- the pictures don't do it justice.

- it's pretty lightweight.

- the color is a little darker than the picture shown- it's a very dark plum

- it runs bigger- this is the only retailer sweater where the sleeves of a m are a little to long. 

- the style is decidedly casual and ""slouchy"". it looks great with jeans, but don't plan to dress up an outfit with this piece.",3
"This dress is gorgeous, flattering, oood quality and, in my opinion, better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black, rather than nude liner, which really brought our the beautiful embroidery. come on, practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something. i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug, though, but at least it's stretchy. that being said, it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up. i was glad i had a black half slip on as well. the fit is tts but a bit short wa",3
"I loved this dress and tried on the xs in the store and then ordered the petite. i thought if i ordered the petite it would not be as baggy. it is just way to boxy/baggy for someone my height and weight. however i would recommend to someone taller because the velvet is great quality and it would have been an amazing dress to have for fall and also for winter. for reference i am 5'0"" and weight 113 pounds.",2
"I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it ""might"" be sort of cute. a comfy, flowy, warmer to cooler weather transition top. little did i know how much i would fall in love with it! i tried it on over like 3 things in the fitting room, including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store, and it still looked great! it is comfortable, loose, and goes with pretty much anything (i've tried and still haven't found anything it looks bad over). it's not super dr",4
"I love almost everything about these jeans.  color, fabric and rise are perfect.  unfortunately, they bag at the knee on me.  should have ordered a size smaller than my usual, but since i have worn them, i will keep them.",3
"I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall, go for it!!",1
"Bought this for my brother's wedding and i just received it. i ordered my usual size xs. it's a tightly woven knit, with little to no stretch in it. i could barely get it over my head and my arms could barely fit in the sleeves. and i don't have big arms at all. for reference, i'm pushing 5'7"", around 125 lbs. i'm glad it's so structured because i was worried that it would lose it's shape with this material make-up. but, no. it's really fitted. alas, i need to try again with the next size up. ma",3
"I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5""2"", broad shoulders, 120 lb)",4
I love this long knit skirt! it is great for any of the cooler seasons! it has a lovely somewhat a-line look when you have it on. the knit is a light weight but has a nice feel to it. true to size. i love the length to pair with tall boots!,4
"I usually wear stevie's in ag, but when i saw the prima was on sale i decided to give it a try and i""m so glad i did! they came today and i tried them on, i will say the rise feels a little higher than mid-rise, but it's so soft and stretchy i didn't really care. they're definitely skinny but with so much stretch they feel like a comfortable legging that doesn't fit quite so tightly. the color/wash is great too. for this price, these are awesome. i ordered a 29, same as my stevies and it fit per",4
These pants are so comfortable and cute!! you can dress them up or down!,4
"I loved the look of this shirt, but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest. it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant.",2
"This is a thick material, but it is also airy. i got the white and don't have to worry about it being see through. it is a little boxy, but the hem hits a good length and doesn't bother me. really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures. a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting.",4
This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.,3
"This dress is easy to dress up or down, and is very comfortable.",4
"I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.",4
"Love cloth and stone. this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured. soft and casual, with great design details.",4
"Did want to love this jacket because i have so much black and white, but i saw it on my daughter and had to have it. i usually take a large, but i needed an extra large, and the fit is great. the material is not too heavy, so i know it can wear it year round by adjusting the weight of tee underneath.",4
Lovely top that will be a great year-round staple to my wardrobe. peplum and pleats are flattering and not bulky. good weight for spring and beautiful for fall with a cardigan. looking forward to wearing it with high -rise jeans and and pencil skirts.,4
Very comfortable. im 5'2 so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length. no need to roll up. slightly slim fit but not overly tight. typically order everything online and didn't need to return. ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded black/dark grey.,4
I bought this shirt in the turquoise color with the navy trim and love it! color is as pictured. shirt is very soft and flowy. the length was a little shorter than expected (the slits on the side almost reach the top of my jeans) so i'm glad i got the regular xs and not the petite. this shirt is unique without getting too crazy!,4
"Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!",3
"I usually don't do jumpsuits because i'm 6 ft tall and the torso is usually too short. i saw this one in a store though and decided to try it on. it's very light and soft cotton and fit great lengthwise! overall, the fit is way too large though. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i was swimming in the xl - as in the waistband was at least 4 inches too big. the back of the waistband has elastic so if you aren't sure what size to get, size down. i got a size l and it's still a bit too big - the back",3
"These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall, but run large. depending on cut/style, i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these, and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero, but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!",2
"I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the ""skirt"" is adorable.",2
"This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length",4
"The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8"", 155 lbs), would look great on someone more slender.",1
"I tried the b&w one in the store. liked the look and feel of it. fabric is soft and comfortable. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. this dress runs large. size 0 was too big on me - armhole, waist, length, etc. i'm ordering 0p online, hoping it will fit better. not a huge fan of the black belt, otherwise very happy with the dress.",3
"This is absolutely gorgeous cardigan! the pictures don't do it justice! it's comfortable and soft and very trendy at the same time! i bought it in teal and in medium, i am 5'3"" and usually wear 10-12! even though i think it runs tts, but for more fitted look, medium fits better ! i am blond and this color looks great! i also loved it when unzipped the upper part, it looked even better! it is perfect with leggings in grey, blue, green and black, also beautiful with aqua flora leggings and with re",4
"Ok, this shirt is like my dream.  it's large, comfy but sexy with the back dip.  as a larger chested lady (32g), i really appreciate having a tee that i can easily throw on and look put together.  clearly, this is a larger, styled swing tee but it's one of my favorites.  paired with a cute pair of boots, and easily worn with a jacket.  it can tend to fall off the shoulders so i'd size down.  i'll probably pick up the grey too.",4
"This dress is really cute, but it runs quite large. order a size smaller! i got a lot of compliments on it at the party i wore it to. it can be dressed up or can be casual with a pair of sandles.",3
"I was lucky enough to hit retailer day in san diego and snagged this little number - it is truly better looking in person. the dress hugs in all the right places and actually fits tighter than the model shows, but the material is that soft, but stretchy and gently molds to the shape of your body. i was really surprised, i would have never tried this dress from the photo shown. so glad i went in - it's really adorable!",4
I love this jacket and can't get enough of it. it has side pockets as well as the buttoned-pockets. i love the cinched waist option for a more fitted look.,4
"I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful, but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere, my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me, as well. possibly great for pregnancy, because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.",1
Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.,1
"This dress looks simple, but man is it unexpectedly sexy. and oh so comfortable! the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else. add just the right accessories and this dress transforms. i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy. and did i say how comfortable it is? the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool, saturated denim color. i receive compliments every time i wear it. love love love.",4
"The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.",0
"When this arrived in the mail, i knew there was a 50/50 chance of a sheath dress working with my body-type (athletic on top, larger on bottom). i usually wear size 6 in a-line dresses, and i found this dress, size 6, in the sale room, and barely squeezed in. ordered size 10 and love it. (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b) the belt is adjustable, which puts everything in place. the front collar blends seamlessly into the sleeves, and the brocade panels are such a great quality of material, reminding m",4
"Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned, it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well.",4
"I love the color combo, and the design make me feel tall and thin. i know this is going to be very cool to wear on a hot day. i like it with my white jeans, and you can wear it a number of ways. i love this brand, i still wear the plaid from last spring. it's a got to have.",4
"Don't pass this one up ladies....the fabric is casual and relaxed, but the drawstring-like collar gives it class and flirt all at the same time. i paired it with a jersey mini skirt and the way the banding at the waist falls on this top made it look like one whole dress. i can wear this with cropped jeans, shorts, anything! truly a homerun. i'm 5'10"", 138lbs and small fit perfectly.",4
Much softer fabric than i expected. wrinkles easily.,4
Lovely sweater which fits true to size. i wish i would have known it was 3/4 sleeve....,3
"I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love",4
"I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them. i got two pairs last fall, one in purple and one in red. i purchased a pair in sand this spring, and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week. i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year (stained them then first time i wore them). these pants are great, but the violet color doesn't quite match the color in the picture (which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year). in person, the violet",4
Love this dress so beautiful embroidery is lovely....well worth the price!!!,4
Nice warm long cardigan that can work for many seasons. works well over a dress.,3
"The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin, kind of scratchy & has
almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as
movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!",0
"I purchased this jacket in my usual size s, but wish i would've chosen the m. the small works, but the sweater sleeves are tighter than i would've liked, making it hard to layer other clothes underneath. the sleeves are also just a little too short.",3
"Wow this dress is very flattering! i have a fairly small waist and not-so-small hips and this dress is slimming. it is also soft, light, airy, gorgeous! exactly what you need on a beautiful spring day! i wore this dress yesterday and have not felt that beautiful in a very long time! thank you so much retailer for the brilliant design:)",4
This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...,0
"Love this un-basic white top. it's very flattering on, and i love that it's a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i am usually a size 8 in maeve tops/dresses, but i found a size 6 fit me a bit better in this particular top. if your'e in between sizes, you may need to size down. i definitely recommend this top!",4
"I liked this top (in black), but it didn't fit me well. had to return.",2
"I'm 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.

unfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.

i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.",2
"I love that retailerpolgie has petite sizes now. i am 5'4"" and 115lbs. i bought the 0p and it fits perfectly. the dress is very cute and the colors are a way to transition into fall when its still warm out.",4
"I had been looking for an off the shoulder top (or open shoulder) as the trend is really in right now, but that proves more difficult for me (muscular traps and shoulders, not always flattering)... anyway, i decided to order this ( i saw it paired with a wide-leg jeans, tucked in)... that is how i like it... tucked in. it is otherwise a little boxy on me (wide shoulders means the whole thing shifts out. the fabric si a tiny bit wrinkle-prone, but not too badly. both colors are nice, but thought",3
"This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable. i usually wear between a 34d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect. i got it in black and while it's really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs. online. online it looked to me to have some purple to it, but it is definitely 100% black in person (just an fyi). i also thought the tassel was cute, but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person. still a great bra.",4
"This jumper is gorgeous! i usually don't instantly spend almost $300 on one piece without contemplating, but as soon as i tried this on, i fell in love. i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big. please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller... i am 5'3"" for reference and even at 5'3"" it's barely short enough to not be too long on me. so if you are an inch or two taller, i would recommend the pe",4
"Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.",1
"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms

very soft and warm sweater, the boucle body almost feels like comfy pajamas! lovely heathered pasted colors as well. i found the large to be too big - the sleeves fit fine as they are a tighter knit, but the body sagged oddly. medium was the best fit.",3
"Okay, so in terms of quality, i'm not sure these are really worth the price given i paid $18 for similar pants at a cheap 'teeny-bop' store, but i do love them. the legs are much wider than they look on the model but the shirring at the waist and the inverted tucks below the shirring make them hugely figure flattering. i found that they did run a little large but couldn't size down so i hope they don't stretch out. (bought xs, 5'7, 115lbs) the shirred waistband is a little loose but i like how t",3
"This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!",4
"I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight, sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big, so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first, but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2, 4, 6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details, but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's",1
"Like the look of this tank, ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase",3
I'm dying for this skirt in the picture. where is it??,4
"I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...",1
"The fabric is very light weight, more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho",4
Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.,0
"This is a beautiful sweater with vibrant colors. it is versatile and can be worn throughout the year, it runs true to size and has become one of my favorite sweaters.",4
"As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality, worth the money!",4
"Love this dress and have bought the style in three color/pattern variations. fits comfortably, looks polished yet effortless. appreciate that the sleeves come closer to the elbow, gives it a vintage vibe.",4
I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.,2
"I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however, i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd, 5'3, and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go",2
This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.,2
"Pretty pyjama pants that can be worn running errands, dropping off kids.",4
"This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement, i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!",4
"I've had this jacket for a few weeks and it has been a terrific transition piece for the spring. this is a lightweight layering piece without any lining. it works well as a topper for cooler morning temps and you can still wear it later in the day without perspiring through it. i bought it in the olive color, which works with just about everything and the xs was tts (for reference-5'4,116 lbs.). the fit is slightly boxy with a nice swing and drape in the back. for those concerned about the back",4
"Beautiful,lightweight and well tailored 
more dressy than what it appears in photo",4
"This top is beautiful. i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture, and it's gorgeous. the adjustable strap is nice. there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top. this is seriously my new favorite, could not recommend enough!

for reference, i am a 34a, and purchased a small.",4
"I am 5'1"" and curvy, and purchased this dress in medium petite, and it fits to perfection! i love how light & breezy it is for those hot & muggy summer days. the tie front makes this style very flattering for all body types, and the skirt is lined so it is not see-through! plus, the pockets. this dress is a winner.",4
"I love this kimono, it's so soft, very beautiful and delicate. so flowy just like picture... gives your outfit such a beautiful addition!",4
"I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace, in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami, which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it, my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made,",4
I've read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but i'm so happy i did! i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap. it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining.  however i think it depends on the person. because neither of those things actually bother me. i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy.  i think it's extremely comfortable and looks very cute on.  the zipper d,4
"I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!",3
"Got this dress in the mail today, and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own. my 5'5"" athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this. that being said, the fabric is a soft, shiny blue/green. the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back (on me, anyway) and i think that's fun. who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays ? i'm keeping it. i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots.",3
"I fell in love with the print, it is much prettier in real life. more teal burgundy on yellow and more vivid than it shows here. the waist elastic is too tight and high for me....would prefer it looser and not on natural waist. but i still bought it and am ordering a second one in hopes that the elastic tightness is varied.",3
"I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.",0
I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7,2
"Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap",3
"This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small. 
i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.",2
"I saw these in the sale section on line and just loved their look. they fit great and have a cute little flare at the bottom. i like the reinforced inside seams which means they will last longer. i've been wearing them with my shorter boots and booties this winter. i have slim legs and they aren't too tight and not too loose. my inseam is a 33 so they may be a tad short on me, but i love them.",4
These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!,4
"I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short, to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale, i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me, but i rolled them, which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.",3
"This is a sweet, lightweight top that i will wear again and again. nice touches in the front and back. little keyhole opening with two buttons at the neck in back.",4
"I have the pink plaid pippa and this mint one is nothing like it, but in a good way.  shorter, sweet embroidery but the same swing silhouette and drop waist style.  this dress is a little oversized so if you want more fitted look, you can size down.  stay tts if your busty like me.  imo, the mint looks more sky blue than green.  i got the medium regular and i'm 5'3"" 140# 36dd and ends at my knees.",4
This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt. not a heavy weight but very warm. the color is vibrant. many compliments.,4
"I ordered my usual size 6 from retailer and it fit perfect. for reference i am 5'8"" and 137 pounds. unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress. it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest;) i really like this dress. i think it's beautifully made. is it my favorite dress i've purchased from retailer, no but still a nice dress:)",4
"I like to wear swing tops because they are comfortable, not confining. this is definitely true for this top- i have an xs and it is quite spacious and boxy shaped. this is a simple cotton shirt but the ruffle adds a nice detail, and without being too much ruffle either. great to throw on with jeans!",3
Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.,1
"How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size, yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount, the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough, the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref, i'm 5' 5"", 32a, 115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr",2
Definitely a good buy especially when i bought it on sale! it's warm and can be worn dressed up or down.,4
"A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged.",3
Love the fit. nice and warm and good quality material.,4
"I am not a fan of unlined bras, but this one was so pretty i had to try it. the lace doesn't look cheap, but overall i wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. it fits well and the support offers a nice shape (no cone!). i might go back for the other color.",4
"This one is perfect for the taller ladies (or those looking for a longer fit). i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently, and this one finally works for me (at 5'7"" with a long torso). awesome quality, not overly delicate, and beautiful detail.",4
"I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.",1
"Lovely blouse-- very well made. i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing-- right now somewhere between a 36d and c. the medium was a little roomy for, i could've easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size. quality fabric, very comfortable yet dressy. i'd definitely recommend this blouse.",4
"This dress is great but extremely short. i'm 5'6"" wear a size 4/6. the 6 looked like a tunic on me it was so short.",3
"There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also, i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it.",2
"I ordered a m/l in this vest and it fits perfectly. thirst is cozy and stylish. in fact, i ordered the same vest in another color! it's versatile enough to wear with both skirts and jeans. i also think it's a timeless piece that will stay in style for years to come.",4
"This is a beautiful top, the fit is very flattering. i'm tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow. i wear it on the weekends and to work...very versatile. i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry, it's the same size and no fading..not sure about the others below with shrinkage issues. highly recommend it!",4
"I did not have the same experience as the other reviewers. found the color just as pictured - a dusty pink (made to look worn - so may not be your thing). fabric hangs nicely and is slimming on me. long enough for leggings but great with jeans, booties and long necklace (needs accessorizing). the aged look may not be for all, but overall i love it.",4
"I love these jeans. at first, i was unsure of what shoes to wear with the length of the crop. i don't wear block high heels ( as pictured) everyday chasing after my boys. but once i figured out which shoes looked cute i was in heaven. the fit is very flattering and it will be a great jean for everyday fun!",4
"This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7"" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!",4
I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c,3
"This dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days. the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture. since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out, i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting. the length on the petite size is perfect for me.",4
"Love, love, love this shirt! much like last year's bordeaux shirt in this style, it's very soft, very flattering, and very comfortable. fits tts, and the fabric is a very soft, stretchy cotton, yet not too clingy around the mid section (it has a nice, flowy fit#. it washes great, doesn't pill #again, the fabric is fantastic), and holds up really well. i bought the black with white stripes this year, but i'm tempted to get every color. it's great for layering too since the fabric is nice and thin",4
"This sweater is heavier and has more of a swing shape to it than i had expected. but it is fitted enough at the top, that it still fit the bill. the pink is woven with a taupey color, and the effect is great. almost a little retro.",3
"Adorable top, but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top, also by maeve, but the sizing on that runs small, medium, large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more ""square"" in the torso, and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also, i didn't",2
"I love this sweater but i'm on the fence about keeping it only because i haven't figured out a way to layer and wear it. it really does appear best with a plain white top and jeans. i've tried it with several other things in my closet and just haven't found another combination that sells it for me - i really like my pieces to be more versatile so i can mix and match them into other outfits. this piece is just enough of a ""statement"" that - for me - wearing it with more simple clothing staples is",3
I got this at the sale price and it fits great. the bottom was wrinkled so it was not as open at the end like the picture but i am sure an iron will help.,4
"I tend to like grey, black simple clothes with a splash here and there for everyday. this will be perfect in the fall/winter. it is wool, so be prepared for the felted wool feel, but it is casual comfortable. i am 5' 4"" and boxy. the medium is still roomie on me but that is how i like it.",3
"Love these pants. ordered in petite .,love style, great fit but so long . 
keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches. 
decided to order the black & green as well.",2
"This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.",4
"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!",4
"This is a surprisingly cute faux-fur coverup! it's much cuter in person than on the model. i will be wearing mine over a little black dress, for the holiday parties. it's very glam! perfect for going out. it's also very soft, snuggly, and comfy. most faux fur makes me look gigantic and wide, but this one looks a bit like a little capelet or shrug, and very flattering. it flares out nicely in the back too, and it has a pretty lace-knit stripe pattern on the back. it does shed a bit though. also,",4
"Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.",3
"I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans, boots and a striped or plaid tunic.",3
Beautiful! color is true to pictures. no stretch. no liner. looks good with white or nude tank.,3
"This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely, but between the fit and the scratchy fabric, this is headed back. too bad!",2
I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.,2
"I love the beautiful flowy material and design. definitely runs a bit large. i ordered an xs and it needs to be taken in as well as taken up. i would have ordered the petite if it wasn't out of stock, so the length is probably fine for most. shimmery detail is beautiful.",3
I love the pattern and shape of this top. i can dress it up a bit with white pants and heels or dress it down with shorts and sandals. nice fabric and fit.,4
"These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts, tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.",4
"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)",0
"Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso, and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that, the material is a very good qu",2
"I bought the white in my usual xs size, i don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.",4
"I had to go up one size, but i love this blouse! dressy enough for work, and you can make it casual with jeans. tight across the chest, but the next size up fit perfect!",4
"Love the bright red color. such a comfortable fit, but still feminine and pretty. could be dressed up or down. will definitely be a summer favorite.",4
"Could not let it pass at a sale price. got the 0p and its a bit snug on the waist (25 waist, 34a, 102lbs) otherwise its perfect. will keep the size. dress hits me just above knee like in the picture. its beautiful in person. the details, the quality, the flattering fit...perfect",4
"Very versatile tank.....i will wear it with slacks, skirts, culottes, jeans. it is soft; and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture. i ordered the white; and i may order the black too. i am 5'4'', 130 lbs. ordered in small. the armholes are perfect - no gap at all.",4
"This is a very sexy suit. it took some time to figure out how to put it on. it needs instructions, but it is well worth it.",3
"I love the fleetwood style...very trendy...fit like a dream - very long for you leggy gals. me, i need to hem (these would also look cute as cutoffs for us shorties)...true to size - slim fit!",4
It turned out exactly as i'd hoped - very well made and very classy!,4
"The top is really cute, but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.",2
"I was hesitant about this one since i've tried cloth & stone shirts in-store and found them to be tight in the shoulders and arms. i have athletic shoulders and arms, so i didn't have high hopes for this one. i tried it on in-store and it's surprisingly true to size. i always wear m in tops and this fits perfectly. it is long, but i like that there's enough length that i can tuck it in. for reference i'm 5'3"", 130 lbs, a cup, 17"" across the shoulders.",4
"This skirt looks just like it does on the model. it is the prefect maxi skirt with lots of movement. i actually bought the off the shoulder top it is paired with. you can't tell on the model but the slit has buttons up it so you can undo or do as many of the buttons as you want to show off as much leg as you want. it is a little pricey,but well worth it.",4
"Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%, which you don't see often anymore!), great length, nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch, but as someone with a small waist and wider hips, i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure, these might work better",2
"I ordered this in the ""chocolate"" color which is really a pinkish/taupe-brown. but i love the color; it's neutral yet not too pale, just the right hue to go with almost any color and the style works with any outfit, from jean shorts to a dress. i love how soft the knit is. although i worry it might be prone to snag, especially the open-weave sections. i also love that the sleeves are full length, fitted enough to be pushed up on my forearms yet i can pull them down past my wrists when i am chill",4
I have not worn yet but excited to try it out soon with jeans and boots. comfy but has a nice sweater look...not too casual. sleeves are very long but don't think i want to downsize.,3
"I was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i tried it because of the detail but didn't hold out much hope because it looked frumpy on the hanger. i was very wrong. it fits beautifully. it drapes nicely, hugs the shoulders perfectly and doesn't droop open due to the embellishments. there is a tiny closure where the fabric crosses in the front so you are not exposed. i liked that feature very much. the sleeves are 3/4 on me, but i like it - nice change of pace. this is a very different style",3
"The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size, figure flattering, and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece, this is it!",4
"As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me, i tried it in a small, medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2"", 145lbs, 36d. the dress is really pretty in person, but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9"", 100lbs, 34a, also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline, however the neckline is not open like in the picture, it's more pushed toget",1
This dress is a fun idea- but the one i received had misaligned pleating so a few of the rows of sequins were tucked into the pleat- it threw the lines of the dress off. i ended up returning it but i think it can be amazing if you get one that looks like th stock photo.,3
I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.,2
"I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer, i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6"" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.",3
"I can't rate this with enough stars or numbers! great fit, can't see up the sleeve, perfect length, just right amount of fabric for draping. i am 5'3"" and 130lbs. fits like a dream and when i got it home from the store....it goes with all things in the closet!!! my one reservation is it only comes in one color. let's get on it designers! we need a lipstick red for summer and coral and navy and black and white. i don't need any other top! this one has great cool fabric and you don't need to wear",4
"I loved this dress online, however i did not love it on me. it was a bit snug in the waist and bust (i usually order a 2 or 4 but got the dress in a 4). i thought i would love the mid length but it felt awkward on me (i'm 5'10""). i think its a beautiful dress just didn't work for me.",3
"Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.",0
"I wore this dress to a baby shower. it fit nicely and i received many compliments. i liked the weight, it flowed while walking and it was quite sweet.",4
"Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra, even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts, black pants, and skinny jeans",4
"I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.",0
"This dress is nice, but it won't do for my purpose. i considered it for a mother of the groom dress, but it's not long enough for me. the dress is pretty, but very sheer and very low cut so it would require opaque undergarments. it's not possible to tell from the pictures how sheer this dress is.",3
"I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through, but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.",0
"This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly, falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!",4
"Love the top. love the color. love the back detail. as a larger chested woman, the shape was lost a bit. but i just couldn't resist.",2
"This shirt dress has the right amount of body skimming drape and length to flatter my short potbellied square waisted self, i wish they made more versions more colors more sleeves!",4
"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!",1
"Wonderful fabric. surprisingly great fit. super flattering. i'm so glad i bought it, despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online.",4
"Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5"", 125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.",2
"I love this dress?sophisticated and amazing?fabulous fabric. however, if you are petite and take a 0, it will be enormous! i am trying to decide if i send it back or have it altered.",4
"I'm a teacher and am always looking for easy to wear pieces that will also work for my job. i also walk in to campus with my backpack, so i need something that looks good but is comfortable. 
this dress drapes beautifully, is really soft, and has a wide, flattering neckline. i'm short and chose the regular size instead of petite so that it would hit right at the knee. it's definitely on the generous side: i usually wear an s and i sized down to an xs.
i can definitely see getting a lot of wear",4
Super comfortable and flattering casual jeans. i'm 120 lbs 5'7 normally size 26 and the 26 fit perfect.,4
"Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers. i ordered in my normal size medium. neckline is cut a little low, but not enough to change my mind on the purchase.",4
This dress has the perfect amount of swing to it that it hides a stomach - which i looooove! the blue chambray color is beautiful and it is lined partially. so here's what i don't like - this dress would have been so much better fully lined. now it could just be that i am extra sensitive to fabric and find it to be a bit itchy where the ruching is on the upper back of the dress. but i somehow can't get myself to take it off the hanger to wear it....i may just be returning this dress.,3
"I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky, loose fitting, professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.",1
"This is a beautiful and versatile skirt. i love the layered detail, length, and flattering cut. 

the fabric is a 80% cotton/20% linen blend. it's a thick weave with tiny nubs here and there. the skirt was made in turkey.

i usually wear a size 4 in retailer skirts, but i sized down to a 2 in this skirt. the size 2 fit at my natural waist and looked as pictured on the model, whereas the 4 looked bulkier on me,",4
"Saw this online, but it said the store was out of stock. imagine my surprise when i went to my local store and found it in both a small and a medium in white.. i tried them both on, but not a lot of difference in the sizing. the small had a smaller head/neck opening causing it to be a bit tough to remove without getting makeup on it, which the small did. the medium fit very very close to the small, but a smidge bigger at the neck. the shoulders of both seemed to fit the same, with maybe a tad mo",4
"I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!",4
This dress was absolutely gorgeous and beautifully made. i ordered a size down as the other reviews stated the dress ran large. however it was massive. i wanted this dress so badly and mourn that i had to take it back to the store.,4
"I'm very happy with the interesting print and unusual bib design of this comfortable dress. the bib embroidery is off in some areas. i find that the swath of beige to be too much since it almost matches my skin tone. to break it up, i took the unnecessary waist tie and used it as a bodice trim, creatively knotting, tucking and securing with mini safety pins. i purchased the m petite and though it has a zipper back, i did not have to unzip to put this on or take it off. i have a heavily padded up",3
"This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere, and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures.",4
"These are super cute on. they shorts-length lining inside, which is great.",3
"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!",1
"I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south, but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin, but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8, weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8, but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.",4
There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.,2
This is beautiful dress with great fit. i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size. the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel.,4
"I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i",4
On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.,2
"I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful, the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didn't want to take it off until bedtime. it is an all around winner. if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem. i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it, it is just too comfy and cute!",4
"This dress has a really elegant neckline combined with the wide fitted waist and under-the-bust gathers which really flatter the body. i have a fairly straight body and this dress gives me shape. i usually wear xspetite but the turquoise didn't come in petite and that was my preferred color. so i tried the xxs which i could barely get on and off but once on, it fit fine (34aa, 26"" waist, 34"" hips). i'd probably be better off with the xs. the length of the regular on me was fine, like a normal ma",4
"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available.",1
"This top is beautifully constructed, fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra, accommodates my larger bust 34dd.",4
"I ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding. i love it. i think it will be fun, and it is unexpected for me. i will need to order a smaller size.i am 5'-5"" and almost always wear a 4 in retailer wear. this ran a little big on the top, i will be ordering a 2 and sending one back",4
"Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.",1
This is such a comfy dress and recommend it to anyone. pairs amazing with leather boots and hat,4
"There'd a reason this dress is all over instagram and like. it's stunning and beautiful, perfect for a wedding or event. the beading is beautiful and the tiers on the dress are more flattering than you'd expect , especially since it does have a bit of pouff to it. love it, 5 stats! i sized up so that it would be longer",4
"This is my favorite jumpsuit purchase of the season. flattering, casual look. well made light material. easy to dress up or down. can't wait to wear it again!",4
Fits nicely - i'm a standard size 4 most places. also perfect for those in-between occasions. can be dressed up or down and worn with flats or heels :),3
"I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt, with long boots, booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!",4
"Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.",0
"This is one of my favorite new retailer buys. originally got the green for a family holiday party and went back for the sapphire. the cut and design are great. for reference i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and a 34a. the light weight fabric is perfect for so cal winter, but the real winning feature(s) is the detail. so, so cute. only complaint is it wrinkled fairly easily, but i'll deal with that for a cute form-fitting (but not too fitting!) top. .",4
This is a pretty basic black dress with a swingy silhouette. the slip that comes with it is much tighter than the dress. the transparent sleeves and open-work details help it look a bit airier even though the shape is loose. the neckline has a flattering v-opening. i was able to try on a petite size at my local store (i suppose it was a returned item). the petite was still a bit long for me; it did not hit me above the knee but rather at or slightly below the knee. the dress was cute and comfort,3
"You know when you're shopping and you don't buy something you like, but later you can't stop thinking about it? that was the case with his sweater! i saw it paired with a cute top in the store so i tried it on on a whim. i'm so glad i eventually got it! it's toasty, soft, and thick with the perfect amount of quirk.",4
"When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.
i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.",4
"Love this top! not too low cut, drapes nicely and the material is thin enough but not so thin you have to wear a tank top. it does seem to run on the larger side.",4
"I've always loved the idea of jumpsuits, but could never find one that worked -- either the print was too crazy, or the length was too long, or the waist line looked funky on me. this one worked perfectly. i'm 5'4"" and the regular xs fit nicely. can't wait to wear this, especially in the spring/summer.",4
"I wish there were be fewer asymmetrical tops in the store. i see many tops i like until i discover they have an asymmetrical hem and are longer in the back, which i do not prefer.",3
"Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it. the true color is a little darker, i would call it a taupe. the fabric is really nice. i am a 34 c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences, and they run small. the medium is perfect for my size. i usually order a small panty, and this one fits, it looks smaller than pictured on the model. this set is one of a kind, the pattern on fabric is really beautiful. i think it is worth the price. if you like lingerie,",4
"While the fabric, embroidery and sizing are dead on, i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so, it must go back to retailer.",2
"I love the dress enough to go on a diet. i sized up but still have reservations about the integrity of the seams if i should sit at any point during its wear. i hate skin tight clothing, and wear a 0 in everything else - the 2 made me feel as if you could see my cervix. i own other byron lars dresses that fit in a 0 - something happened with this dress.",3
"I didn't love it enough to buy it, but did think it was cute. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.",3
"I admit, i did not intend to buy a jean-dress but the cut - i could not pass it up. classic and vintage dress style. the fringy hem and more conservative length is so fun and makes the strapless top stand out. with a stunning necklace this will be a versatile piece. no doubt.",4
"It took a minute, but once i figured out how to wear this, i loved it. it is meant to be oversized, and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots (too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt). i'm 5'9"", curvy and long limbed. the fabric has a thick, high quality feel; i find it quite soft and comfy. the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic; it's fashion forward without trying too hard. the ""cowl"" is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold, which works well for",4
Free and easy but the fabric seems cheap.,3
I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!,2
"Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet, it's almost weightless, which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!",3
"This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit, the fringed part was huge, kind of ""maternity."" i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about 4 inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously, it cannot be altered. so sad, must return.",2
"Bought both colors - nice quality top, but they do run large. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs.",4
"I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress, church dress. however, it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.",1
These are a great versatile pair of black pants. they look chic without trying too hard and they work well dressed up or down. they do run a bit big as others have said. i generally wear a 16 and thats what i got in these but they're definitely big and bag out by the end of the day.,4
"Based on some reviews i decided to get the regular xs, even tho i am an xs petite (5'2, 107 lb, 32c) i found the fit to be flattering -- fitted enough but not too loose or tight. the length is perfect and work appropriate, and the material has some weight to it. the grey one is colorful and cute. the only problem is the bagginess of the arms -- very unflattering. if i push the sleeves up, it hides the bagginess a little, but i would like to have the option to wear the dress with long sleeves., s",3
"Super long even at 5'7"" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me, so even at the sale price they're going back.",2
"Fyi-the model is wearing the top with a cami tank under. on it's own, it's lace and has holes throughout. i prefer it that way, so you can layer to make it more conservative, but also wear with a nude bra for an edgier look. material washed well and has a pretty raw lace edge seam on the bottom!",4
"Tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me, as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of it.

pros:
- love the ruffle trim along the collar, bottom, and wrists. it gives it a really romantic feel to it.
- a definite winter piece. it's extremely warm and very thick and heavy, which i found covered any lumps and bumps nicely.
- ran tts. i'm 5'9"", 36c, hourglass, and 170 lbs and tried on the medium and fo",3
"My mom pointed out this dress in the store a while back and i said ""cute, but no way i could pull that off. ""i am a short curvy and busty lady and have never been able to wear strapless dresses. i ended up ordering it for a wedding and it was a perfect fit!!! i got the petite small and the fit up top is snug but comfortable and holds the ladies in with no bra needed. amazing. the fabric is dreamy and this dress is so easily dressed up or down. hides flaws, excellent all around.",4
"The blouse is lightweight and is double layered, meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1, a bit busty, and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.",4
"I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line. i fell in love immediately and didn't think twice about paying full price. i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good. the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green, which gives it extra character. very well made. i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings, but they are very secure. 

i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms. i would definitely call it tru",4
"If i could sew, i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however, this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well), but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of",0
"Sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast, just out of curiosity. and sometimes, they're surprise hits, like this one. i tried on the purple/black/blue option, and i had to have it. it is boxy through the torso, but the length keeps it from being too cutesy--it's pretty short. i'm just 5'5"", and i'm not sure this is work appropriate without tights. i may have to try, though, as otherwise it's a great workable dress for summer--not too tight or revealing in the b",4
"I'm consistently a 0p in this brand, but i ordered a regular zero, and i'm glad i did not get the petite because it would have been too cropped for me. it's a bit boxy, and the material is thicker than i thought, but it is a versatile piece that look forward to wearing!",3
"I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.",3
"Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on, much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.
i returned it same day i received it, which was disappointing.",1
"I have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went sale-on-sale. they're very cute and definitely true to size. i was worried the white made me look big, but with a longish shirt it's fine. also, they aren't made from the most athletic fabric - i think if i sweat in them too much they'd get icky fast. i don't sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect they'll be fine!",3
Love this tunic dress but i ordered a petite instead of regular because of length. fits a bit snug. i have gotten sp from retailer before and they have fit. just depends on the brand i guess. great holiday wear.,3
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.,4
"This is my new favorite summer dress, seriously. i purchased this dress while there were no reviews at the time but i'm so glad a took a chance. the colors are pretty close to the picture shown; maybe more of a lilac hue than mauve. i normally wear a 6 petite or a 4 regular in dresses, so i went with a 6p. as other reviewers have mentioned, this dress seems to run a little bigger so i could have easily gotten a 4 petite (for the shorter length) and it still would've been flowy. i have chosen to",4
"This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.",2
"This top is super soft cotton, with raw edges on the sleeves and hem. i bought the green top, which is a medium, faded olive color. despite the picture, this top is shortish in the front and on the sides, which are slit. the top is also very, very boxy. it's wide across, and doesn't ""fit"" the body at all. the sleeves are a slimmer fit, which contrasts nicely with the wide body. the picture is very deceptive. that said, this top is perfect for early fall/ late summer. super comfy. floaty. i wear",4
"Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!",4
"I bought 2 in the store.  i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesn't have petites, so i tried a large, and it was tight in the bust, but i loved the shape.  i ended up buying xl's and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit.  gives me a small looking waistline.",4
"This top is so cute. a little cropped, light for a sweater tank in my opinion, and runs a little big so i sized down one size. beautiful fabric and fit, the ruffles are such a fun addition! definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work - so cute!",4
"I like the color blocking of this top, but it was too large and billowy on the bottom. it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape.",1
"This skirt is great to wear to work. nice medium weight. being cotton, it doesn't get to hot. skirt is lined. nice flattering shape. my normal size 4 fit perfect. love the godets. comfortable. doesn't get all wrinkled from sitting. nice royal blue color.",4
"My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips, too loose in the waist, and too tight in the knees, and i don't have big knees. also, the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed, they seem to have a 32 inch inseam, and these were regular, not tall. basically, i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves, and very long legs for this jean to work.",2
"Cute design. runs big in neckline, falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1"" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet, but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats.",2
"Really cute skirt, but difficult to get on! i had to shimmy it over my hips due to the lack of a much needed zipper. i am not very curvy, so if you got them, forget it! i sent back the xs - hope the small is a little roomier because it will make a pretty summer skirt.",3
"Love this, it's a great update your basic tee!",4
"I was so skeptical about ordering this; it's really not my style. i'm more of a black halter dress kind of person. this is so cute, and flattering. it's well made, not flimsy, but is soft and pretty. i'm 5'6"" and weigh 130. i bought the small and it fits perfectly; the dress hits me right above the knee in front. i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar, or wearing it wiht6 leggings ans shooties when it's cooler and dress it up with jewelry. side note; i'm",4
"So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.",3
"I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i don't mind :) it's a trend of the season and i absolutely don't mind to look like a mattress or wear robe. the garment runs large so i wear usually 6 and have to get xs. i am 5'6"" 146 lbs usually wear s/m in jackets. it hits me 2 inches below my knee. i love it.",4
"This really is a gorgeous jacket! i would give it 4.5 stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area (poofs out a bit) at certain times, but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat. i am petite and curvy on bottom, so this could just be me. tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute, i think i will try both ways. seems very warm. beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all! excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l",4
"I typically wear xs or s, or zeros but i got this in a m.  it doesn't look big, it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small.  it's soft beautiful and warm.  the hood is so cute.  the detail is just so good.  i love it over top of 2 long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs.",4
"I bought this dress as a back-up for my bridal shower and loved it when it arrived. it does run large, so definitely size down. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress, but the quality is high, the color is really vibrant and it's a comfortable fit. i'm 5'5 and it fell to my knees. i paired it with black tights and booties and plan on wearing it the spring with wedges.",3
"I love this fabric, it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors the sapphire is great. i wish it would be offered in red, like the cowl neck long sleeve tee. with that said, i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd, and while i wish it were a few inches longer (3/4 sleeved). the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality.",3
"I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress, twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print, i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s, with tights and boots, but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders, so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not",4
"I love the ruching on this hoodie, which is why i ordered it. i'm typically a size small, 34b, 130lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band. i might order it in a medium (although the sleeves will likely be too long) the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color. it's more of a brown gray (instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen.).",4
"Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself, but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!",4
"I tried this on (in the store) on a whim....then had to have it!! i'm normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit. good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store!! super soft, comfy...a great purchase!! fur is removable for easy washing or a different look!!!",4
"Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders, normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.",2
"I was a little skeptical to buy this dress at first because of the pattern. in all honestly, i am so happy that i did. it's so unique and truly a one of a kind design. when tried on the dress is very slimming.",4
"Love the top! it fits perfectly. i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as i'm a 34dd, but it doesn't. i've received many compliments on the top, its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing. it is sheer so you'll need something under. the material is quite light as well which is nice.",4
"This tank is perfect. it fits close to the body, but does not squeeze. it is super soft, smooth, and comfy. it layers perfectly under blouses. this is by far my favorite basic tank!",4
"I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring, and it seemed perfect. plus, the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed, but i'd say surprised. 

i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly, i would prefer it to be less stretchy, but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality",2
"Super cute pants, fit and color just like model picture. i fall between a 28 and 29 waist, and all that was available was a 29; so i ordered it online. however, when they came it was just a bit too big/loose so i had to return them. if i had been able to get just the right size (maybe size own a bit if in questions) i think i would have kept them.",3
"Pretty tank, embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price, should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.",2
"This feels and looks like a ballet skirt on, so light and flowy, super comfortable, just love it! extremely flattering cut, tiny gathered folds at waistband add pretty detail and create a slimming effect on my tummy, what's not to love?! great pockets too! i have a 34 inseam and the length is perfect. ordering in both colors now as i can see these becoming my go to bottoms all summer long....",4
"This dress intrigued me a bit online, but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack, i wasn't so sure about it, but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh, flattering, flowy, light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric, the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist, but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great",4
"I purchased this skirt on super-sale but i'm hesitant to keep it. it's not poorly made, just not as sturdy as i would expect a skirt of its price. that said, it's cute and comfortable. i wish it came in numbered sizes because the m is snug but i expect the l would be too big. has a good amount of stretch. shows underwear lines. love the style!",3
"I want to wear this skirt every day - it's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it!
can dress it up or down - it's pretty darn fabulous!
i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!",4
Was looking for a layering tunic and this does the job. it's very long and i'm 5'11 and this covers to my mid thigh. the arms are very tight but stretched after a while and the material is thin. i like the button details and the olive color are a nice break from black and white. white might be see-through.,3
"Trying to hold back and not purchase this beautiful sweatercoat but 20% off on retailerday and reviews saying it ran large, i ended up getting it. my store stock only went up to l (i normally wear xl in retailer tops) but read that they ran large. i did try it on and it seemed to fit and is gorgeous, but once home i saw really it was too tight in the upper arms and i don't want to order the xl which might be baggy, so i'm exchanging it for 2 walking on snow sweater/jackets which are very flattering!",3
"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those, ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful",2
"This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size.",4
"I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8"" frame. wish it came in a tall size!",1
"I highly recommend this top. i am busty and was concerned that it might not be flattering. but i find it flattering. i also don't have the greatest arms, so i wore a crisp white top underneath. see my pics below. hides any tummy pooch and is so flattering. runs tts. i ordered a small. i'm 5' 120 lbs. the petite might have been too short for my taste. don't hesitate!",4
I bought this in two colors : the green which i love and the washed out look adds some interest to make this other than a plain tank. i also bought this in white and it is completely see through. i will never understand why designers don't pay attention to how fabric would look as soon as you put a bra on. if you want to wear a tank under your tank then get the lighter colors otherwise i would stick with the green.. honestly debating on whether to buy the bright blue color but i fear it's just n,3
"In the store i was immediately drawn to the blue/white combination, but on the opposite side of the rack hung the spring colored one, which i ultimately tried on. it was obvious that the dress was a bit oversized, so i chose the smaller of my two dress sizes (10) to try on. this was the right choice, but it was still really big. i am not sure that i could have gone down another size (mostly i wear a 12 in dresses that are fitted), due to my bust (36c) and broad back/shoulders. from the front, th",3
"The fabric is quality, nice thicker fabric. the fit was strange, the top part fit great through the arms and shoulders, except my bust makes the front stick out and results in a maternity look. it was also slightly wide, i considered taking it in on the sides. ultimately it wouldn't be worth the money. it would be a great top for someone with a smaller chest.",3
"I got this i n regular xs (i am xsp or xxsp), so it fit fine considering is boxy. it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual, it gives a nice ""dress-up"" kick to any jeans, shorts, capris. im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody. just be careful since is delicate

"I bought this for our daughter. i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin. the purple is a stunning color - very subdued and classy. if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened, guess who is going to keep it for herself! if she loves it as much as i think she will, then i'll just have to get one for myself. the pleats in the back are very flattering. best of all is the fabric. it is luxurious. thank you retailer for yet another",4
"I found this cardigan/sweater in the sale room at retailer in navy. thought i would just try it on. the picture does not do this justice. it is a basic piece but it is so soft and comfortable and when on, it has a little bit of a whimsical swing to it. i loved the way it kind of came to life. i wear a m/l and bought the m. i have a 36d bust and it looked great. it is a nice weight for spring/fall. it is not a heavy sweater.",4
"I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7"" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty",3
"Cute shirt, great for a lazy day off. i got an xs, but i thought this was a bit lose especially around the waist. the shirt is good quality, the material is heavier, great for spring/fall. it goes well with leggings and a jacket.",3
"I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.",1
"I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it's like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9"", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me.",4
"Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.",4
"I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back.",1
"I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.",4
Very light weight and soft fabric. i bought the blue but did not try green or grey. i love blue with my skin tone and am afraid green may make my skin look yellow. did not see the green in my store though. very comfy and flattering dress. runs tts.,4
True to size and love the color. great to wear dressed up with wedges and a blouse or dressed down with some mephistos and a tee. linen fabric makes them light for summer heat,4
"Cute but not sure it's worth the price point. i might reach for it in sale, and while it was cute on, i just don't spend that much on a daytime casual dress. i'm sure you could dress it up with heels or something but there's something about this dress that screams casual daytime. still very pretty and flattering! i loved the neckline and detailing there",4
The romper was really quite and looks just like the picture. quality felt good too. but when i tried it on the sleeves just didn't look right on me. they were too long and too big. for that reason i decided to return it.,3
I loved the contrasting design of this sweater. i loved it even more when it arrived. its soft and true to size. i received so many compliments which sealed the deal.,4
"This one is a must-buy. i have 3 of the longer sleeve version (the tegan dress) and one of these. i am about to buy more of the lola/ short sleeved version. these dresses are flattering and comfortable. they can be worn as a tunic with leggings or a dress. they are great for travel. if you roll them, they don't wrinkle. they can be dressed up or down. my sister and i have very different figures and this dress looks great on both of us. i can't recommend a dress more. the lola and the tegan are t",4
"When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.",4
This shirt is a simple but versatile top. it goes anywhere with anything so it's a great travel piece. i'm curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw. i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of 'sugary' as one guy put it. it's quite comfortable and doesn't bunch up when one sits down. i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it 'pop.' a great piece for one's wardrobe.,4
"I love the fit of these pants. 5 starts for that. i wish the pockets were a little closer together, but it's not the end of the world considering how well they fit. the real drawback is that the dye runs like no other pants i've had before. i had them on for a few hours and my fingernails had turned green and my skin was a greenish color. i am going to try to soak them in water a few times to see if that helps. i would still recommend these pants, but wash them a couple times before you wear the",3
"Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it! this dress did not disappoint. for reference i ordered a size 4 and i am 5'5"", 135 lbs, 34b chest. in the chest area it fits perfectly, while the ribcage area is a little snug, but not uncomfortably so. the pockets are great. the denim quality is great. and i like the frayed bottom of dress. i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men. which i thought was quite interesting because i",4

"These are my favorite jeans i've bought in the past year! they're the perfect length for booties, i love the rise, and the denim feels amazing- so soft. mine haven't stretched more than a normal jean (in fact they may have stretched less than others i've had), and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact.",4
Such a cute top! can be dressed up or down. i wore it on sting break and had many compliments.,3
"Runs really large. i am 5'4"", 120lbs, 32c, and had to exchange xs for xxs for width, but then the sleeves were a little tight. decided to keep the xxs in white.",3
"As soon as i opened the package, i knew that this is going to be my all time retailer favorite. many reviewers mentioned how puffy the sleeves are but i see it as quite proportioned with the rest of the dress. tts i am 5'5"" and 128lb, ps fits perfect. i am an addict of retailer dress <3",4
"I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup, smallish in other proportions (125, 5'6"") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?",2
"Beautiful dress that is well constructed. the fabric is substantial and feels expensive.i am 5'4"" and weigh 134, 
36 bust 29 waist and ordered the m/l. i usually wear a 6-8 in dresses, so i worried that it would be too big but it fit perfectly. i am very happy with my purchase.",4
"I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k",4
"Love this skirt. super comfortable, yet nicely tailored. roomy pockets always come in handy. the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet. this will be my go-to skirt for the fall for both my business-casual office environment and weekends out and about running errands, etc. i agree with the other reviewers re: sizing: because of the stretch, if you?re between sizes, you should size down. i'm usually a medium, or size 8 or 10, so i got the 8. i may have been",4
The fit and design quality was grea! i love the fact that xxs petite is available online.,4
"I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.",4
Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!,0
Very comfy versatile skirt. the fabric is soft and stretchy that feels really nice on. i live in hawai'i so i like having skirts to wear that work well with the climate but not typical of the fashion out here. the pleating is very flattering and the skirt layer underneath makes it wearable to work.,4
"I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.",0
I really love this top. it looks so sweet and beautiful and is perfect for dressing up a pair of jeans. if you are on the short size it may be a little long so keep that in mind. i love it!,3
"These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.",1
"I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color, but it was just unflattering on me.",2
"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however, it doesn't even cover my butt, that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4"", i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.",1
"I recently purchased this vest and unlike other reviews, i found it to be tts. with that being said, i am typically a medium in retailer tops or 8/10. i have broad shoulders (5'9, 145lbs). i purchased the medium and it fit perfect through the shoulders. it is meant to be flowy and gives some volume in a good way. if that's the look you are going for this is the top for you. had i gone down a size, i would not have been able to hook the top. i am going to be wearing this with blue jeans and white s",3
I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable. it runs small i am usually a size 6 but had to get it in size 8. i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer. it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans. the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt.,4
"In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back, but front was just too clingy. back it goes.",1
Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(,1
"If you look closely at the photos, the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved, navy blue cardig",4
Ordered the nude color for my daughter. love the color and the style. it's a.comfortable looking top. i pressed it before giving it to her. seemed to wrinkle easily. that's why i gave it three stars. probably wrinkle less if it had some polyester in it.,3
Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt,4
"This dress has rich color, excellent quality fabric and wonderful style. you can wear it now for fall with boots and jean jacket or in the summer for a great sun dress.",4
"This dress is more lovely in person than in the picture. the lace details show beautifully against its nude slip. i'm 5'1"" 130# and regular size 2 fits perfectly and hits at my knees. it's a very flattering dressy-casual dress. it's a bit pricey for a cotton dress but worth it at the 20% retailer promo.",3
"I purchased this in the ping/orange color. i am 5""8 and 155lbs, the medium fit perfectly. very soft texture with a nice flow. will be purchasing in other colors.",4
"I was looking for a new spring/summer tee that still gave coverage for chillier mornings and nights and this is it. it has a nice swing to it that isn't too wide (think a flattering a-line cut that has some movement towards the bottom hem.) it is fitted and flattering where it needs to be (the shoulders and ribcage run fitted and tts which means you don't get lost in the top. it's not boxy or oversized, but if you want a fitted and more flattering look, you can definitely size down easily, parti",3
"The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.
also, the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.
needed to return",1
"This may be one of the cutest items that i have every owned! runs big, i am a 4 and the 0 fits perfectly.",4
I tried this dress on in hawaii before it even hit the website. i am guessing retailer tests out their spring line in always summer hawaii. i was impressed but wanted to wait for a promo. there is a lining that fluffs up the skirt part of dress and makes it fun and girly. i sized up to 4p from my usual 2p in holding horses due to the tailored upper part of the dress and my shoulders a wee bit wide.,3
"This is a very substantial, warm sweater that is so classy and super soft and just different enough. really great with neutral sweater leggings or jeans with boots. you have to wear a longer tank or tee underneath as it it split on the sides but the belt cinches the whole sweater in.",4
"I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra, its just too much. it's a very loose fit throughout the body, but the shoulders, arms, and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just can't do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.",3
"This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d, and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition, the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately, this top will be going back.",0
"The print and detail on this dress are so much better in person, especially the neckline! i agree with the previous reviewer in that it felt spring-timey to me. flattering fit and flare however the top runs extremely small. i am usually a 6 in retailer dresses and i could barely zip the 8 over my bust but the 10 was enormous. rest of the dress fit fine but if you are large up top you might want to size up. fabric does not stretch. overall too cute to pass up! for reference i am a 34dd.",3
Probably one of my favorite turtle neck sweaters! it looks so chic and cute on!!,4
I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle. i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle women's clothing and these were perfect. they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day. i also wear these to work on fridays! i bought a size 28 and they fit great. i usually wear a 6 in us sizing.,4
Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!,4
"I am 6'2"" and athletically built, and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me, but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length. it is very flattering. the weight of the dress allows it to move with you. it is form-fitting, but loose at the same time, so your body doesn't look lost in the material. you can dress it up with heels, or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual.",4
It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!,0
"I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area, it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).",3
"Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!",1
"This top is fun to wear & looks great with black, grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!",4
Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.,4
"I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.",1
"I really like this shirt. the design and colors are very good. i ordered the black one with cats, it was cool. however, in general i don't like high-low tops because they don't look flattering and you can see that it is asymmetrical from the front, makes it awkward. the shirt's design doesn't make the high-low aspect stand out much which is great. but it is a tad shorter than i would like in the front. it is also loose fitting. it is perfect for a slimmer frame, but on my curvy figure it just wa",3
"This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!",4
"The fabric, colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy!
i am 5' 9"" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!",1
"I usually wear a small, 4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.",2
These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.,4
"I purchased in white. the material is a little thinner than i like, but the material is soft. runs tts over all. the arms are long-but i like this in a t-shirt. i will probably pick up another color in this shirt.",3
"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.",2
The most beautiful top in my closet and i have a huge closet of beautiful clothes! hope retailer carries more peasant top by this brand...stunning,4
Nice non clingy cut. has details so more than a basic t-shirt.,4
"This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful, overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.",2
"I bought this in white and coral. i usually wear xl, but both l and xl fit well. i bought coral in l and white in xl. it is a tad see-through but not a lot. the top is comfortable and looks very good on, coral is so dreamy and white perfect for a casual day out. i am not crazy about linen fabric though, it can be a bit scratchy, i would have preferred if the top were in a softer fabric. for now though i plan to keep both.",3
"I usually wear an 8, which wasn't available, and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty, the skirt is fully lined, the length is not too short, and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version, but on the black it stands out.

it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.",2
"This is a lightweight sweater...good for the office and summer evenings.  here in so. cal it's a good weight sweater year round.  love the lace trim.  runs a bit large but not too bad.  color is a light cornflower blue, not lavender.  this works for me but if you're looking for a lavender sweater, you might want to think twice.",4
"Well-made, gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person, which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs, etc.) 
you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.",4
"The colors in the green shirt are beautiful, however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6"" 120#, not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall, wispy , less curves...",2
"I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.",4
"I love the color and the design of this pant....looks very bohemian. it runs large and it has sort of a ""short"" inside of it that is made of a silky polyester...so, it's not as ""loose"" on the inside as you would think. this ""short"" is not a bad thing...but, it's something that is good to know. i love them and will definitely be wearing them very soon...",3
Love the dress but ended up returning it as i'm not sure how often i would wear it. the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress!!!,4
Lovely! feels like you are wearing silk and hits for comfort in all the right places. still mulling whether the short length is appropriate and if my athletic/full lower body is complimented by this cutie...needed a second opinion to push me over the top and take this home as a summer staple,3
"I absolutely love this top. it can be worn with shorts or jeans, dressed up or down. it fits perfectly, i am broad on top so i ordered a large. i bought it in white..i wish they had more colors. love it.",4
"I know i'm going to get a lot of wear out of this t-shirt this summer. i have it in white, and it's not too see through, which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts. it's basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra. i love its drape--it's not too form fitting. on me (i'm 5'2), it tends to be a bit long, but i like it. the shirt being cotton means that it's super soft. as far as washing goes, best practice is to machine wash and hang to dry--i'm afraid of",4
"I got this dress in the holly green and it's a lovely shade - perfect for fall and winter. this is why i gave it the high rating. however, be warned that the lining is very form fitting. i thought the dress had more of a fit and flare design to mask flaws like a belly and larger backside, but that's not the case. i had to return it, but for more slender-shaped ladies, the dress is likely a winner.",3
"Overall this top is very cute. it needs to be ironed before you can really judge it's cuteness! the sleeves are short and feature gold toned plastic buttons. for the price of the shirt, i thought the buttons looked cheap.",3
"I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background, with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does ""really pop,"" and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . .",4
I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.,2
"It is a little pricey for what it is, but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!",4
This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!,1
"I hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my go-to sweater for the season. when i tried it on, i knew i made the right decision - it feels luxurious and fits like a dream. the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters! the fit is tts.",4
"While i agree with the previous review that the peplum hits a bit high, i like this top. it has other features that i really like. the dip in the back of the peplum is great and i love the longer sleeves. i have it in both the black and the mauve and they are becoming quick staples in my wardrobe. i have a fuller figure and feel good in this top.",3
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit nicely. tops from tiny can sometimes be really tiny, but this blouse is cut correctly for it's size. i'm full figured and busty and the xl fit comfortably. if you're athletic or have a petite bust or are slender you might be able to size down.

"The quality of the fabric is good, but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass.",1
"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable, machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl.",4
"Super cute, casual top. i'm usually a medium and this fit perfectly (5'9"" 145 lbs). it's not quite as long as it is on the model, but cute nonetheless.",4
The only negative about this dress was the placement of the stripe across your stomach,3
"This dress is absolutely lovely, from the neckline to the fabric. really feels like a well made dress. i will say that it ran larger than i thought though, so keep that in mind. it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest. still gorgeous though!",4
"I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.

"I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no",1
"I adore this dress! it's so charming. great quality, lovely fabric, beautiful color. the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably won't work on a beautiful curvy body. with a petite athletic body, i feel beautiful in it! i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small. pair it with black or camel, sandals or boots, it's lovely!",4
"Nice fitting, pretty and feminine. looks great with skinny jeans/leggings and boots. good in spring, fall and winter!",3
This skirt is so flattering and comfortable!,4
"This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small, i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.",4
"I started stalking this dress when i saw it on a store's instagram feed, and i was so thrilled to get it in the mail. however, i ordered it before reviews started popping up, and i was concerned it would not fit in the bust. however, when it arrived, the fit is perfect. it's not exactly loose in the bust, but there also isn't any pilling. the high-waisted nature was also suited to my shape. i'm usually between a 4 and a 6, and the 6 was great in this dress, and a perfectly joyful length--appropr",4
"I really, really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty, and the front was flattering, but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly, i sent it back.",2
"I wanted to love this dress. i've been looking for a cute, flattering red dress for ages and snapped this up on sale online, thinking it was finally the one. when i tried it on i found the shape flattering, even to my recently pregnant figure. other than that, i was highly disappointed for two reasons. one, quality issues, as mentioned by a previous reviewer - the slip is sewn in totally unevenly, resulting in it sticking up above the neckline on one side, with several threads poking up above th",2
"Super cute blouse- great with a jean jacket, - sleeved or sleeveless. pleating is neat and a nice unique detail, without getting to full. usually a 4 or small in blouses, bought the xs. made this decision based on the arm hole openings, seemed a little large and set low on the small. .",4
I love this coat! it is exactly what i was looking for. it is unlined (with cute fabric edging on the seams) and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it. also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom. it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings. also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down. it's a great contemporary shape. i would say this c,3
"This vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about 5-10 pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn't have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it's a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i'm 5'6"", 140, and usually wear a 6 or 8.",3
This top is well made and the pleats give it a whimsical feel. i'm still debating on keeping it as it's slight boxy.,3
Love this sweater so much that i'm going to order another when it goes on sale! the material is not thick but it's a nice thin weight that i still feel cozy in. i love that it's not long in the back too. so cute and soft.,4
I love this top! the length is just right and i love the flow of it!,4
"Tried this skirt on in the store and loved it...so pretty,feminine and versatile,except for the color.. although its a gorgeous color and i do love red,how often do people wear red skirts? i would have snatched it up if it were offered in other colors. unlike the other reviewer,i think the ruching is great as it gives you the option to wear the skirt higher or lower on your waist and adds the axtra interest factor. as this would be a totally frivolous buy,i'm going to resist and try to wait for",3
"I think this romper is super stylish, kind of dvf-ish and it's as-pictured except it's more colorful in person; the vines are pink and pale aqua, and the flowers are deeper yellows with white & beige parts and pink dots in them. i see what other reviewers mean that the fabric is thin, it is, but i wouldn't say sheer. it's a lightweight woven fabric. the problem is there's no stretch, so when you reach up, the whole romper hikes up. i think it's true-to-size. i got my usual xspetite and it fits g",4

I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent,4

Love this blouse. it fits well with a slight flare at the bottom. doesn't wrinkle much and washes in cold water perfectly. have had compliments on the style and design. a definite buy!,4
"I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i",4

"I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd.",3
"Lovely body hugging dress. hits just below the knee. great with boots as shown, or with heels. very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty. i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night. this is a winner!",4
"These pants have substance in the material, it seems thick. i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail. my only ""complaint' is they don't come in petites, so on my short legs, teh hem came jsut above my ankle. i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model. did not purchase,but keeping in mind for future...",3
This is a great layering piece. took it on a trip and wore with both a long sleeve and tank under it. is more 'khaki' color then the photo shows - which was a goo thing for me.,4
"I ordered this on-line, in a size 8. the fit is ample and fine fine, and the fabric is acceptable, but as much as i wanted to like it, and keep it, i ultimately returned it. it is just too, too conservative for me. i loved the deep olive/khaki colour, and even experimented wearing it open as a duster over a top and slip pants, leggings, or skinny jeans, but the collar and the front pocket styling are just too man-tailored and cargo-like in their styling for me. i tried it with different belts, w",3
Great dress. bit see through on the skirt. need to wear slip with it.,3
"I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!",4
"I purchased this in the store. i thought it was cute and unique. i like most things with a raw edge. i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and purchased an xs. i have worn it a couple of times and have received several compliments. my only complaint is that when i saw the pic online, i was annoyed. the top is much wider than the photo depicts. lying flat it measures 24"" side to side at the hem and 24-25"" from shoulder to hem. why take photos that misrepresent the item? there will only be more returns. so if you li",3
"Well, another major score with pilcro!
these pants, in general, are my go-to pants--so i had high expectations when i bought them.
(i have about every color in the hyphen cut--and always hope they make more pairs)
and, what do you know, they've met--even exceeded these expectations!

love the fit--true to size--even though i will order another smaller size when i get smaller! these are good enough to have that ""big pair"" and that ""oh, i feel svelte pair!"" the denim has just enough stretch a",4
"I ordered this on a whim, not sure what to expect. i'm petite (5'1, 110) and ordered a small petite. i usually wear xs-s in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs. it fits beautifully and is very cozy too. the collar is gorgeous and very soft. i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe.",4
"Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.",4
"I really wanted to love this, but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref, i'm 5'3"" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area, but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it wasn't that i didn't realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back, but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look",2
"Non-stop compliments! i wear this with dresses at the office, and denim on the weekends- super versatile.  this is one of those pieces that you keep forever.",4
"This dress is a beautiful, classic dress that is figure flattering and as stunning in person as it is in the photo. i love it!!!",4
Love everything about this sweater. i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s. hope this helps!,4
"These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design"".",4
"My only con would be these are long...even in petite they are long. otherwise i have no complaints. i love the comfortable fold over waist band! ah. i am planning to wear these on a long flight...they will help me look put together and keep my legs warm (i always freeze on airplanes) plus they will feel good! i am 5'4"" and must wear more than a flat sandal...i tried on with a wedge and it worked well. not sure if i will hem or not. might wait till after washing. lovely. ordered my typical pxs (d",4
This dress is perfection and i bought the blue one. please make this in black or other dark colors.,4
Just received this dress and i am in love! the colors are beautiful- perfect for both summer and fall. the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch. i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer. it was completely sold out in my size 0. however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color (and now lined yay!) i had to buy it. would defin recommend!!,4
"Tried this on in store with red ag ankle jeans and the only thing i could do was chuckle. it looked like a sleeveless lab coat or butchers coat. take your pick this styling was not for me. the fabric is nice not flimsy. you can see whatever pants your wearing underneath but i guess that's a moot point since it does have a substantial side slit. it does run tts. i'm 5'3ish, 118# and the size 2 fit ok. probably would have sized up to the 4 because a slight pull at the chest (34d-dd). in the end i",2
"I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin, it might work for you too.",1
"I ordered this dress in the black motif and a petite size. the color is slightly more washed out than depicted probably because of the stretchy fabric used, but it is still nice. the dress does run large. the length is a bit too long and the pockets which i was surprised were even there are several inches too low for my 5'2"" frame. overall though, this will be a good dress for hot summer days and should travel well. i wish the blue, floral one was available when i ordered this dress as it looks",3
"The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price, i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.",2
"The photos on the website do not do the dress justice. i am into texture, pattern and contrasting fabrics, this dress is gorgeous in person; not only has pattern, but the pattern is woven, so there is this wonderful texture as well that i had to try. some of the reviews said the dress runs large, others that this is a bodycon dress. i ordered a size 8 and my usual 10. both were figure hugging but the size 10 allowed this to be office wear while still being flattering. i am fairly straight, small",4
"Saw this in the catalog and had to have it.  i paid full price!   while the buttons aren't functional, it is not too revealing.  i work in a casual office and it will be perfectly appropriate especially paired with a jean jacket!   the length is right above knee.  i am 5'6"" 122# and went with the xs",4
"I recently purchased this dress and i am very happy with the quality. it is a little bigger than i anticipated, but nothing that can't be fixed with a cute belt! the embroidery detailing is gorgeous.",3
Love this so much. it's beautiful and i get tons of compliments. it's a touch short as a dress but looks amazing with leggings!,4
"Love these jeans. fit great. i've had other colored denim from ag that stretched out too much, were too thin, but these are a nice thicker fabric. i ordered the red and the moss, and the red fit a little better than the moss in the same size. not sure if the dye process affects the fabric but the red pair seemed a bit more substantial. the moss is great too though, so i may keep both.",4
"This is just as it looks. a minimalist, elegant, dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years. it is straight, so you might want to consider sizing up unless you're quite slender. i'm 5'10"" and 160 and am sending back a m for a l. excited to get my new skirt and to wear it.",4
"I wanted to love this dress - everything about it was so beautiful - except the fit , the length, the neckline ... i tried on a 4, 6 and petite 4. i'm 5'5"" 130 32dd - the top of the dress runs small/tight - so i needed to try it on without a bra.
the length on the regular is to the floor/with the petite to my ankles. the print was beautiful and like in the photo, it flowed nicely but there was just too much fabric - maybe it was just the design for me - it did nothing for my figure at all",3
"I love this top. in fact, when i saw in the store, i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home.",4
"I saw this in that postcard ""catalog"" and it drew my attention immediately, so when i saw it at the store, i knew i would try it on.
this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things, the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy, but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7"" and it hit me right at the knee, so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring",2
"This dress is just as it looks in the pictures. shapeless. the trick is to add some styling to it. add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf, and your all set. i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black d'orsay flat. the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt. i usually wear a 4 in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well. i'm 5'3ish"", 118#, 34d-dd. this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre",3
"Purchased this dress in black and love it. there is so much detail in the crochet, and can be dressed up or down. i am contemplating buying the same dress in white!",4
"I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an",0
"The dress is lovely and fits true to size. i like the petite fit. i would note, however, the dress length does not match the description. the description states the dress falls 45"" from shoulder. i measured it at 40 inches. it is definitely shorter than i was expecting.",3
"I was so excited to receive these jeans. typically, wide leg jeans are a no brainer for me--super flattering and in chambray, i thought, they would be stylish and comfortable. but i found these to be verging on mom jean. something about them seems not so cool. maybe the color of the wash, the weight of the fabric? not sure, but they don't lend themselves to current looks. sadly, i will be sending them back.",3
"I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes (s,sp,m) in the coral, green",4
"I saw this dress couple weeks ago and i really liked its color. the dress was ok untill i wore it. well. it's one of those dresses which are not great on hanger but great on you. well, the color is awesome, matches with other bright colors, mustard yellow, wine or black. the material is very thin so if you put size down it will fit but make sure that you see yourself in the mirror and see your back; i saw many ladies which put the dress which fits them but it does not fit the way it supposed to",4
"This is a modernized hippie sweater, so beautiful. blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality. the large flowers add attitude, pockets show comfort. it is soft (part silk fabric) and lays nicely. it is not thick enough for warmth, but there is room for a tissue turtleneck. regular s fits me well (it should be relaxed look, not fitted) and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and the hem falls right above my knees).",4
"I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j",1
"I thought the colors would be brighter and i didn't realize the lace would be see through. i returned it because it was also shorter that i expected. but overall it was a nice dress, just not for me.",3
"The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it, the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of",3
"This is a darling dress!  it is super flattering . . . except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders.  unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulders/chest.  i ordered a size 4 and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body.  i'm 5'4"", 118 lbs.  wish i could have kept this one!",3
"I purchased this shirt in two colors. it was a bit longer than i was expecting. i'm curvy  5' 2"" 180 lbs 36dd and the large fit perfectly.",4
I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.,1
"I grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little ""throw on"" dress. it's a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design. run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees. if i were 30 years younger, i may have bought it just for lounging, but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out. not for me, but cute for teens and early 20's.",3
"I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6, hourglass shape, usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small, but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short, so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture, so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.",1
"After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering, loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise ""casual"" floral pattern. i would highly recommend",4
"I love the weight and drape of this vest; it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts. i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall. however, it runs a week bit small across the bust. i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit. sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out.",3
"Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small, especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest, just weird look on me. unfortunate, because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.",2
"So there weren't any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small. i had no way of knowing if it ran big, small, or tts. i'm usually a med, but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating. it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length (i'm 5'8""). i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk, but not too light. it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe.",4
"Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering, feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.",4
"These shirts are fantastic; lightweight sleeves for summer wear. i go back and forth between xs and small, (i have broad shoulders) and ordered one of each. i like both. the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looks.

the color is fantastic and true to the photos! not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that.",4
"I saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color. it is more greenish than yellow. i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person. i would not look twice at it online- the picture does it no justice. i am not a pancho person, but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm. i tried the xs/s and it fit perfect - i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho. it is boxy, but that is the point of a sweater of this type. it will be p",4
"I'm not normally one to spend $89.99 on a dress from retailer, but when this dress arrived in the mail it was a no-brainer that i would keep it. it hangs beautifully on your body and the fabric is extremely comfortable the tie at the waist is really flattering and the neckline adds a little bit of fun. i imagine it can go from season to season pretty easily: springtime with a cardigan and flats --> summer with wedges --> fall with tights and boots. i love pieces that can serve different purposes a",4
What a nice sweater! i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters i've gotten in a long time. the fit is true to size. the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms. the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing. the weight is perfect for every season. i am very happy with everything about this sweater.,4
"Fully lined until just above the knee, silk exterior, rayon lining. can dress it up or down. very lightweight and cool-feeling. this is a beautiful dress. i'm 5'9 and it fit great-- shorter people might need to alter it. i tried it on in the store and felt like a princess, but am hoping it goes on sale.",4
"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love",4
"I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my ""wheelhouse"" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't ""pull it off,"" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7"" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took",4
So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are. so some of us that are busty and have a hip--this is nice. i actually could've done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale. it's meant to be loose! it's kind to ladies that aren't all size 2 :),4
"Love, love, love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold, burgundy, black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off.",4
Soft and flowy and perfect for those in-between seasons.,3
"Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it's a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.

if only the was *slightly* higher to hit my true natural waist, it would get that fifth star (but sometimes i wear petite sizes, so that might be the issue here--still looks good tied).",3
"I bought this dress in a store, and it suits the body better than on the picture. the pattern is exquisite and beautiful, i receive compliments every time i wear it. it is made of silk, which is a preferred alternative to polyester. but as other reviewers mentioned, it needs a slip, and for an expensive dress it should come with one, or should be fully lined. it is only lined on top. the peep hole is deep, but on my body, it doesn't gap much (i'm 5'7'' 142 lbs). a keeper for me for its beauty!",3
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt,1
This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern! it's also extremely comfortable. a total steal at the sale price!,4
"I am 5'0"", 109lbs, 32d, and the 0 petite fit tts. the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made. my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip. my dress arrived with a nude slip. i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing. the lace actually stands out. all in all, a greal buy. discounts make it worth it too.",4
Love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual t-shirt.,3
"Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point! similar cut & quality with awesome rises and spandex/stretch content! also, the styles are always on trend!",4
"Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.",4
"Love the color of this- a rich, dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy, not fitted. i ordered a small, then thought i should have ordered an xs,- so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small, but because this is not fitted, the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.",4
"I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i",3
"Lovely, comfortable top.  not flattering on my full figure but would be flattering on most--especially younger women who want to emphasize their curves~~",3
"Beautifully made, designer sweater. and it's soft and comfortable. i decided to return because it's just too much for my body.  the fringe, which is quite long, overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am. the color is true white. the knit itself is fuzzy. it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline. although not for me, i do recommend.",3
They were fine. i had hoped they'd be more like begging a though... more structure. they were very much just leggings and rather unflattering in the crotch area. they felt well made though. might work for someone else. not a bad legging.,3
"I have purchased many of retailer's henley tees throughout the years. this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store. i love the look of the crisp, white, but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami, and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot.

anyhow, this shirt is made in my favorite spring/summer tee shirt fabric: 100%s linen. linen gets so soft and drapey over time. the yoke is lace. the arms have a small ruching that is sewn, not buttoned up l",4
"I saw this online and said to myself, next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white,tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6"", 136 pounds, the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to",4
"Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4"" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco",4
This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.,1
"I bought this top in a size 6 - i'm 5'5"" with a longer torso. i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up. the material is on the thicker side so it's a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape. i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more. i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic",4
"Cute casual skirt, i love that it is longer in the back than the front so i can comfortably wear it to work.  i had to size up, which i usually do in bottoms that do not have stretch because i'm my athletic frame.",4
"I love this skirt! as a fan of different textures and pretty things, this piece exceeded my expectations! i am always a size 0 or 2 in retailer dresses and the 2 fits like a glove. the length is perfect - just above the knee. ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick, neoprene material, i've adored the feel of it! everything feels firm and put together. the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic. it will pair well with lots of different tops too!",4
"This sweater came in just as expected . . . adorable. as others have said, it is soft and comfy. i will wear it everywhere (including work). i love it! :)",4
"This is really cute online, but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder, but the material is very thin, and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.",2
"Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area, some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh, what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty, so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love.",4
"I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.
it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.
the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.",4
"It's simply a super cute and versatile jumpsuit. you can wear it as is or over a shirt or t-neck. drapes well, hangs well. looks good from the front and the back. i am 5-5, 120 lb, size 4 fits perfectly. only drawback, has to be dry cleaned...",3
"I have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it.  i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly!  i am 5'2"", 120# with broad shoulders.  loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile . . .jeans/boots, skirts/heels.   definitely a keeper!  as a petite gal, this was not overly long.  if you have larger hips, this will not hang well.",4
I love this dress even more in person than in the photo! it is more sleek and fitted than it appears on the model. the seams are flattering and the fabric is lovely.,4
Ilove this dress even though it does run big i put a belt with it and it looks stunning.,3
Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.,3
"I didn't have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please.",2
"This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it
on. too bad, but it went back",1
"Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4"", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season.",3
I didn't think much of this online but it was very nice in person. i was nervous it would look bulky but it was very flattering and slimming. fits tts.,3
"I wore this jumpsuit to a newport wedding and got so many compliments! i'm 5'2"" 105 lbs and the 0 petite was perfect with heels.",4
"Love the material (more natural fiber than synthetic), the pattern, and the colors. also, it is cozy! the one con is that it is really big and crazy-long. so long, that it may be a show-stopper. on the fence about that.",4
"I bought the purple motif in size medium, my regular retailer size. the fit is true to size. the knit is soft and comfortable. this top can be dressed up or worn casually. it is a great all-around basic top for summer.",4
"This sweater is really pretty in person, and well-made. every time i wear it someone stops what they are doing to compliment it; one person asked if it was home-made( in a good way) i will admit that i would not have paid full price and did get it on sale, and in that case it's worth it. the sweater does have an unusual cut. the waist is boxy and the back is a bit shorter, but somehow it works. for me i see it as a cool style and not a mistake. it's super warm and i love it.",3
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the top portion fit a little smaller than the typical size i order. the zip side was a little snug, but the fit is very flattering! the lace detail and belted design are very pretty. the skirt portion has more volume than i tend to like, but it is it beautiful!",4
"I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper, i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly, i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver",2
"What a great sweater! the pale pink is sweet but the grey was more my style. i'm 5'5"" 120 (34c) and the xs is perfect. i know everyone is saying this sweater runs large but i believe this style is meant to be a bit oversized, so i would call it true to size with that in mind. the arms are long, the shape is boxy (but not short) and i love the way it hangs on my thin frame. it's super soft & cozy; will easily be a go-to sweater this fall.",3
These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,0
"This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.",4
"This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest, which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame, what with the bold flower and the fit, so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater, this could work well for you.",2
I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.,4
One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.,4
I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.,4
"I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale. when i pulled it out of the package, i could not believe how soft it was. literally, as a cloud. think of the softest, fluffiest baby blanket. also, the cut is extremely flattering. i am 5'7"", 135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly, flowing, but not boxy. love it!",4
"I bought these immediately after trying them on. i was totally surprised to see these very cool, edgy pants at retailer. the color and details are spot on! great quality. i wore them with a blaclk leather high platform boot and black top tucked in. i received a lot of compliments. these look like they should come from europe! i just wish retailer would buy better quality and more interesting things like these pants.",4
"Dress appears to be slim fit, but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3"", but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings, memorials, special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed.",1
"I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person, i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent, and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.",0
"These pants are great, super cute and comfy. the price is too high but i do love them.",3
"Let me start off by saying i never write reviews, but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi",2
"I purchased these pants in blue, they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.",2
This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.,4
"My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still, a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!",3
Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.,1
This dress fits great. i love that it's fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom.  it has a thicker t-shirt type fabric.  i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather.  it's much cuter in person.  for reference i'm 5'4 105 and got xs.,4
"This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!
i would recommend this product",4
I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacket/cardigan. this is perfection. the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality. i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well.,4
"I'm usually a small (5'5"", 116 lbs, long torso), but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures, but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close, mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however, it is rather short, possibly because it is an x-small, and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom, which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect",2
"The dress is really frumpy standing up. something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown. the lace is really pretty, though",1
"I was looking for a dress that would make me feel as special as i would feel when i attend my daughter's baby shower. this design, featuring a variety of spring influenced flower motifs embossed upon an eyelet fabric, was exactly what my mind's eye envisioned! the use of the solid colored shirtdress button line and cuffs softly pulled all the elements of this unique work beautifully together. i found the fit to be almost costumed made for my figure. the number of compliments i received on the da",4
I wish we had cooler weather in california so i could wear this more often. i bought this sweater/coat on sale plus an extra 20% off so i got a great deal on it. i love this sweater! it looks matronly in the picture but it looks very chic and sophisticated in person. the sleeves hit above the wrist as shown on the model. it does have pockets. it's the right weight for chilly weather.,4
"At first i was interested. i liked the color, the soft tencel fabric, the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back. 
all in all, it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.
it does run tts.",2
"The fabric of this dress feels like suede, i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the ""but"": the dress is cut straight down, no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on, like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself, and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses, and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu",2
"I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big, it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.",1
"I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs, but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.",1
"Material is kind of thick. stretchy. the orange i ordered was just too bright for me. i'm 8/10 and got the 10. i think the 8 would've worked better. sending back, mostly bc the color didn't look good on me.",3
"Retailer has the greatest pencil skirts. i usually get 1 every year. the pattern on this one makes it very eye catching with blue birds on green or tan background and black and white flowers in a tree pattern. so it is versatile to wear with many colored tops.
i bought a large because they didn't have medium in the store. it is a bit loose in the waist but comfortable . the rest fits nice and slim. i am usually an 8-10 in jeans.",4
"I bought this today in black. it fits true to size and is very flattering. i love the draping, the weight of the fabric, and the length . i would buy it in another color i like it so much. i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it. i wasn't sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline, but it works. if it wasn't there the top would probably gape open.",4
"Loved this dress. it does run a little long even with 3"" high heels. i am5 '3"", and probably would have been
better with a petite size. often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size. i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side. i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit. not sure if i will hem it. the print is pretty; however, busy. i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic. i added an black belt, w",4
"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes.",1
"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!",4
"This is a very loose fitting style jacket. if you like your jackets oversized, get your regular size. if you prefer the slightly loose (but not baggy) fit like the product photo, size down. as noted by another reviewer, the sleeves are incredibly long. i would say if you are a typical size 0 or 2 (unless you like the oversized fit), you are likely sized out of this jacket. it's a shame, because the quality is great and the windowpane print is beautiful. i'm sadly sized out.",3
"I love how this dress is photographed, but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed. there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever. the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress, but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on. this one is going back.",2
Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.,4
"This dress is gorgeous! the color is perfect for spring/summer. the dress does run wide/loose. i read reviews before ordering and i am glad that i did. i am usually a petite size, but the reviews recommended going with the regular due to length and the design at the bottom (and wanting to be able to bend over comfortably). i am 5'2 and about 116lbs. i ordered the 2 regular and it worked well. i received many compliments!",4
"I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up.",3
"Just purchased this skirt. it is absolutely the most comfortable skirt for every season......every color imaginable will go with this skirt. great with denim shirt too. lightweight cotton knit makes the skirt comfy with any temperature. waistband is wide and slimming to the tummy. i stand 5 foot 10 inches, 174 lbs and it is perfect in length. platform or flats, dress up or down. my favorite is a v neck tee with a couple necklaces and your good to go......",4
So stylish. i have gotten tons of compliments on this sweater. i absolutely love it!,4
It's a bit baggy (i'm normally a 6/8 medium but went with the small here). i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and i'm so glad. the colors are just gorgeous in person. delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch. great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right. looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall. i love love love this dress!,4
"I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large, i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will, though.",2
About a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size 28 petite. i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair. this time i ordered the color ?pink? and of course size 28 petite. well the color really isn?t pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online. the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink. what bothered me more is the fit. this pair was too big. it?s mind-boggling why the sizing,2
"Soft florals on light as air chiffon layers--what's not to like on this romantic dress?  i appreciate the elastic waist and the tie at the back of the neck, as it gives me flexibility during my weight fluctuations.  my only regret is that i'm too darn short for regular length and will have to wear platforms since the back of the hem drags on my 5'3"" self.  purchased the size 8 and i am 140# 36dd.",4
"I have no where to wear this pretty spring time inspired dress.  fits just as pictured, except that i'm short.  i ordered the 10p so my 36dd chest and wide rib cage fit comfortably.  i'm saving this dress for easter or a fancy bridal shower.",4
I absolutely love this jacket! i wear it almost everyday. works as a cardigan or a jacket. my favorite retailer purchase so far:),4
"I saw this online, and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later, and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice. the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body. it's an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear. the first day i wore this i received so many compliments! the colors are vibrant and it's really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the",4
"I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model, but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness, not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"", 124lb, 34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!",4
"This dress fulfills a gap in my wardrobe that i've long wanted to fill: that of the perfect springtime dress. i got the sky blue color in a size 4 (for reference, i am 120 lbs and 34-26-37) and it fits like a glove. the color is vivid and the overall effect of the dress is simple and romantic. i'll be wearing it with casual cognac sandals, a floppy straw hat, and minimal makeup.",4
"I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.",0
"I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy, feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about 2 inches longer, i'm 5'5 and it hits at low thigh, i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.",4
"I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning. the cut was just right, it fit all my slight curves. i'm 5'8 and 145lbs- a slender build and bought the size 8. it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer. the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn. the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used; it looks great without it too. of course this dress comes at a high price point, but with the 25% of full p",4
"The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s",2
Love the colors of this dress. it did run a little large. i ordered a large and medium and went with the medium.,4
"It is beautiful, but not practical for me - the student who carries a backpack ! i didn't notice it doesn't have sleeves, it is regular poncho, soft and stylish . recommended for poncho lovers !",3
"I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately, but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.

i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.",4
"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.",4
"I purchased a small in this dress. 5'6"" 34d. i could have gone with a medium if i wanted to wear a bra. this dress is not meant to be worn with one. it fit much better without. i liked the regular length as the dress is supposed to be a midi. this dress screams ""summer"" to me.",3
"This dress is huge. also, i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse, more like a poplin, and thin. i thought it looked cheap.",1
I got this in the blue and love it. tts and the shape is very unique and classy- better than shown on the model. it can be worn alone or with a long sleeve underneath as a layer. considering the neutral as well.,4
"Love this - bought in camel and cream in xs. runs large. cute with jeans & thigh high boots, leather skirt and booties or just casual. so many compliments... great for wearing a sweater but showing off arms....",4
"I bought this in every color, and would probably keep buying it if there were others - the fit is loose yet flattering, quality is good, feminine pretty ruffles that don't add bulk, and i love that it makes me feel pretty and put-together post-baby.",4
Love this hoodie. i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well. love the color and embroidery.,4
"I am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art, great quality, and super wearable for both work and play, and this is no exception. i purchased this dress in regular xs (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it falls right above my knees. for the office or more conservative setting, i add a belt and a sweater. otherwise, i wear it alone for a carefree look. i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it, and it looks",4
"I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2"", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down.",4
"This bunches up too much, and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it, it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top, i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.",1
"Great, light weight sweater. very simple and soft from the front and the back is adorable.",4
"Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured, which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips, so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure, but wasn't amazing for me.",2
"I tried this on in store yesterday and didn't buy it due to the dolman style sleeves and the scratchy lace.  dolman sleeves look terrible on me, so this was a no go.  beware the scratchy lace...i had this on for about 2 minutes and was itching.  otherwise, this will wok for plenty of people - the color can be a nice neutral.  it does run large - i usually wear a large and sized down to a medium.  it didn't work for me, but i'm sure some will find it a nice part of their wardrobe.",3
"One of my new absolute favs! so elegant and flattering. the dress is as appears online and it is true to size. i purchased my usual size 4 with 27"" waist, chest 34 b/c. note, that there is not a lot of give to the fabric, so busty women may need to size up. purchased with the minuet necklace!",4
"I tried this on (blue) in size 0 or xs (not sure how sizing was), regular size (sometimes i need petite). i don't think i need petite in this one though, i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem, the whole tank is very soft. probably need a strapless bra to wear it, but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants. pencil skirt for dressier look. i am 115 lbs and 30 dd for reference.",4
"This is a fabulous cardigan/jacket!! i saw it on line and read the great reviews and happened to find one of each color in two different stores!! i bought them both!! i have practically lived in them the last week in rainy, cool weather!! the white one goes with everything, and the blue one in fabulous with jeans and probably other things as well. i have gotten several compliments on them immediately. they are just the right weight--not too heavy but heavy enough and a good sturdy, quality mater",4
"And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....",1
"The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans, black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.",2
"I tried this one with the free ship/20% without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece. i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts, but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through! the black color works that magic. the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit. i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches, but this is soft and light. the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person. the balance between the front and back lengths does work a",4
The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure,3
"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect! 
i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event.",3
"Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin, lightweight, and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..",3
"These shorts work well for shopping, running errands, or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size.",4
I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!,4

highly recommend trying them on, they were better than i expected them to be",3
"Nice fabric, very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.",2
"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us",1
Beautiful sweater that looks great with jeans.,3
"I don't understand the negative reviews on this dress. i absolutely love the fit, may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large? yes, the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off, but the fit is very flattering on most people. i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it! the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young. i will wear i",4

"A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however, after 5 minutes of wear, it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath, i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.",1
"I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice, too. however, i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6"" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much.",2
This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers. so many nice details and a great fit!,4
"Ugh. i wanted to love this dress so much. i ordered it for a fall wedding and was so excited about it. unfortunately the cut is so very different from how it is pictured on the model. the color and print are the same, the detailing around the next are even more beautiful than pictured. the length, however is so much longer then pictured. and it's not just an issue of the model being tall. the slip is the perfect length (and it's actually the perfect slip), but the overlay comes down way past my",2
"Ordered this online in a petite 4. (i'm 5'3""/130#). fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has (3 layers total), i think a 2p will be a better choice and not look as full, maybe a little more fitted, which will be more attractive at the top on me.

however, the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality. the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer, a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip. the colors are all very dark",4
"If you're a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this one's for you. the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress. a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my d/dd cup. it does run large. i'm typically a 14/16 and was easily able to fit in the 12, although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage. hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut. the fabric is light and comfortable. my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer. i can not wait to rock this at a weddi",4
You can't go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so don't agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it's perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.,4
"Let's begin with the fabric....it's heavy, but not in a burdensome way. as soon as you put it on, you feel like you have a quality piece of clothing on. next: aesthetics---this dress is flowy and feminine. and a bonus, it made me look bustier than i am; perhaps because of the stripes. i didn't find myself pulling this dress up all the time. once i put it on, it stayed in place perfectly. bottom line: this dress goes from dressy to casual without a second thought. and it's on sale--grab this one",4
"I really, really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately, i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6"", but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)",2
"I saw the ""blue"" version in my store (a return) in size 0. i decided to try it on and i loved it. it fit nicely, was comfortable and soft and the colors were flattering (and cut). (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist), i contemplated purchasing, as i thought it was a bit pricey, but usually i order petite versions. and it wasn't available in that size, until it was. and i ordered it. it came and the fit of that one was great in the legs, much nicer than regular, but the top part was a bit small. the a",3
This top has so many details. i love the material. it adds a little formal to the casual jean. i am waiting to wear this come fall weather with slim jeans and some boots. it gives me that old victorian vibe without being still and formal.,4
I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.,2
"To my knowledge this dress looks great on everyone. the fabric is light and of moderate quality, the finishing is acceptable. a great basic.",3
"I love, love, love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone, and at the moment i don't have enough money to hire a lady's maid, and so i couldn't actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back, so you cannot put it on yourself, unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but can't.",2
"I wasn't expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i didn't like it, i appreciate the design, fabric, and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...can't wait!",4
These pants are so soft and comfortable!! the colors are great too. can't wait to buy more in other colors!,4
"This dress is so beautiful. i am 50 5'8"" and smaller on top larger on bottom. size 6 is perfect! was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places. happy to say it does not. wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than 15 compliments from strangers. just walked up to tell me how great the dress was. colors are so soft and beautiful. would buy in other colors if they had it. i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner, to a wedding our just to feel special on",4
Thrilled this statement piece is back. i get so many compliments on this and it's practical as well for our cold minnesota winters. highly recommend!,4
"This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion.",4
This is such a beautiful dress. fell in love with it at first sight. it is very pretty. can be dressed up or down .. comes with an attached slip that is a tad longer than the dress and it shows on the bottom.. darling dress that will get lots of use this summer.,4
I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!,4
Great jacket for a cool morning. not too heavy and i found it to run true to size. nice little details.,4
"I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference, i'm 5'4, 130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.",4
"After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m, i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb, i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though, and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend, unless you wear 3xxxl",0
"Absolutely love the design, fabric, and fit of this dress! a perfect dress for many occasions, one of the many reasons i love this company! excellent customer service, employees, and of course adorable clothing. 10/10 would recommend buying this dress! and to all the taller girls, i am 5'11"" and 170lbs and this dress is still a good length! no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear.",4
"It's is an absolutely gorgeous dress, one of a kind . you must have it in your wardrobe . my seamstress needed to adjust it just a tiny bit but it's truly fits to size and is emphasizing the figure.",4
I feel like i'm cheating when i put this on it's so comfy almost like wearing cozy pj's but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like i'm lounging at the same time. i wish this came in more colors!!,4
I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.,2
"I bought this dress in the red option. was a little concerned when i read other reviews that said it looked like a maternity dress, but it didn't look like that on me at all. it falls nicely and fits me well - i am 5 ft, 107 lbs - in size xs. love the details at the neckline and hem. will be looking out for other dresses by maeve!",4
"Love love love this dress! i was worried the velvet would look cheap, but it absolutely does not! i bought an xxsmall and it is a little tight in the chest, but everything else fits perfectly ! i bought this in the slate color, but am seriously considering buying the lighter color as well!",4
"Pros:
- fits tts. i tried on a size m and it fit well for my 36c and hourglass frame.
- the cowl neck gives it a nice touch of class.
- love the pop of yellow. not too showy and yet cute and fun.
- fabric has a great feel and stretch to it. forgiving fit. 
- will go with many outfits.
-wore a nude bra and had no see-through issues.
______________
cons:
- does seem a tad delicate, easy to snag due to being a knit, but otherwise solid construction.
- unlined.

"So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that, yet i'm not sending it back:)",4
"These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice, and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper, and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles, maybe. true to size. a little long, so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.",4
"This dress is seriously gorgeous, and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy , pear shaped, and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric, fit and style of this dress.",4
"Similar to the previous reviewer, i'm also between sizes and for pencil skirts it's usually the larger size that end up fitting. whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch, my smaller size (10) fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip. the fabric is wonderful, the skirt length is great for work, and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist. if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit",4
This top is adorable! runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments!!!!,4
"I'm upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb",3
"I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro",0
"The design and fabric on this suit are even more gorgeous in person than on-line. i am 5'4"" and between 138/140 and ordered a medium. the thing i especially like about this suit is that it has adequate cup size and support. i am a 36c or d depending on the bra and this suit is very flattering and provides nice coverage and cup support. the straps can be shortened if you want a little more bust support. the material and design of the suit itself feel substantial and even without the straps, it do",4
"Absolutely love the cut and design of these pants! fit so well and unique pattern at the ankle however, as is the case with many white pants, so disappointed when i tried them on at home and could see my underwear (nude color!) the pants are beautiful in every way except that they need to be lined! going back - may order the black since they're not likely to be ""see through!"" disappointing! was hoping to wear them to a dinner party!",2
"As the previous reviewer stated, this skirt is a stunner, can be worn in all four season. it's long and runs on the larger side. so that you compare, i'm 5'9"" and it goes all the way to the side of my foot. i'm 146lbs, 28 waist, 38 hips and always a medium on maeve, this skirt on a medium was too big for me, at least a size larger. take that into account when ordering. other than that it's a great purchase. can't wait for my exchange to arrive.",4
"I am a short frame with broad shoulders and a large chest which means peplum tops typically look horribly unflattering on my frame. not this top! the cut is very flattering due to the lower peplum. not too much fabric to add to the waistline, truly a perfect fit. if this top came in any other colors, i would buy them all.",4
The stitching on this dress is absolutely beautiful and very detailed.,4
Love this shirt. it's easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms. i've wore it with leggings and jeans.,4
"I love the overall look and feel of the dress. my only complaint is that it was shorter and lower cut in person than it looked on the model and i'm not tall. i ordered a small and i'm 5""4 130 lbs bottom heavy. the skirt is perfectly flowy and hides my problem areas really well; however, i will need to wear a camisole with it to hide cleavage that will show otherwise.",3
"Cute swing tee! fit for me is perfect. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs and i bought my usual small. length is nice. fits me just at my hips. i can wear to work and on the weekends. a little concerned  the fabric may pill so i'm taking extra care. receive compliments every time i wear either color. love.",4
"This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7), it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.",1
"The color, heft, style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.",4
"I love this skirt for so many reasons! 
one, it isn't a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt, the description states that it's a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",4
"I love the design of the suit and decided to take a chance and order despite the mixed reviews. i'm so happy i did! i couldn't be happier with the fit, quality and design. for reference, i am 5'8, size 4 and smaller chested (small b cup) and went with a medium. i could see that this suit might not work for everyone but i love it!",4
"I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color, and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though, the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back, but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though, so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top",2
"I rarely even try on denim at retailer because i'm quite curvy and the styles, while cute on the models, rarely have fit me. not so with these jeans! they're my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price! i'm 5'3"", 150lbs, 32d for reference and i purchased a regular 28, even though i'm often a 27 in my favorite long and lean jeans. they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way, but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office. i will need to get them hemmed, but not",4
"I love this dress. i am wearing it for thanksgiving! i bought the black because the red was sold out, but would definitely buy more colors. true to size. i'm 5'6"" 135 and bought the 6. only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because it's not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me.",4
"I received this dress today and can not be happier. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the 2 fits perfectly, hitting about 1.5"" above my knees. the print is so pretty and elegant. the colors aren't too vibrant, aren't too muted. the collar and french cuffs give the dress an extra flair. it comes with a little slip because the dress is sheer. i just tried it on with suede booties and it looks adorable! i'm ready for cooler temps to arrive so i can wear it!",4
"This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.",4
"I liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store. the price is right considering what some jeans cost today. unfortunately, these are made in china. that bummed me out. they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist. the higher waist is a nice change. it's nice to be able to skip a belt. the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up.",3
This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.,2
I normally wear 0 in retailer dresses. the bottom is roomy but top from band up runs small. i bought a 2 and love it. i plan to wear it to a wedding.,4
"This dress is so comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down and it's perfect for almost any summer occasion. i have it in the black color and it goes with almost everything! the only complaint i have is the arm holes drop a little too low. you can see part of my bra because of this but it's not too drastic. i'm 5'4"" with an athletic build and i feel like the petite would have fit me better. regardless, it's a great dress.",3
"This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer, but does not fit me like the photo size down",3
"Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.",4
"I ordered this sweater and it is beautiful.... i am returning though because it fits snug through chest, shoulders and upper arms. i am an xs - and that is what i ordered and it was tight through these areas. if you are busty it would be a definite problem.",3
"This dress is very comfortable, very flattering and just lovely. my only critique is that the skirt is more rust colored in real life, where on the website it looks more red. and the bodice looked a bit more peach/pink in the picture. still a beautiful, interesting, well made and extremely comfortable dress. thanks retailer! i am 5'9, 155# and the m is great.",3
"I like this dress because it's the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute. i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging. the material is a little stretchy and substantial and there's also a lining. i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit. i am short, small chest, but somewhat broad shouldered, the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures.",3
"Ag jeans have become my favorite and these didn't disappoint. ridiculously comfortable! i think they run a tad big, but maybe not enough to size down. just enough to where i'll need to wash them more often, maybe.",4
"I don't know how this dress doesn't have more of a following! it's really perfect. i will say, i am tall (5'8"") and lanky. the dress is oversized, but not overly so, drapes beautifully, and will work for any season. fabric is divine. i plan to wear this to work, for travel, on weekends, etc. love the cream/deep charcoal color. at the sale price, this really is a great, versatile find.",4
"Just bought this today in xl and i like it a lot. i am very busty so if i see an xl in most things i will try it on. i probably could have fit into a large though. this will look cute with leggings as it is long enough to cover your butt. i didn't know about the emerald color as it looked in store lights, but it is more blue-green at home. i like it even better. well worth $48!",4
"This skirt is really pretty in person. my store had jsut gotten it in when i was in the dressing room and my stylist askedher coworker to bring it for me to try on. i tried on the regular 0 (my sotre dones't carry petite :-( # and it was perfect, length was actually nice. i can't compare to petite, maybe i will order it jsut to see. #i am 115 lbs, 5'1.5"")

"I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big. i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute, but also comfortable. i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric. looks just like pictured on your website.",4
"This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt, skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.",4
"This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.",2
Love this top. i ordered the pink and it was more of a dusty rose. it also runs large - i normally wear a medium top. i am going to exchange it for white in small.,4
"I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available, and lets say i was swimming in the xl, much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two, the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl, seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well, however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely, the suit has boning on the side of the bust, and also the silicone grip on the top edge,",2
"I bought this dress for my upcoming rehearsal dinner in early fall. i love the romantic lace and ivory color for the occasion. i ordered my typical size 10. it hits me right where it does on the model and it fits well on top, but the dress ""bells"" more than the images let on. i didn't want to size down in fear that the neck would be too tight, so i took it to an alterations specialist to get a lot of the lace fabric trimmed off. she took it in a little at the waste and the underarm, and hacked q",3
Very comfortable. super cute! my husband says it's the cutest bathing suit i've ever owned (and i've owned a lot)!!!!!,4
"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.",0
Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.,1
Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!,4
"This dress is a lovely creation! however, i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4"", weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life!

otherwise, this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk, it would be un",4
"I had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit. i'm usually an extra small in jumpsuits, and wasn't sure to get the 0petite or 2petite. i'm 5'3 and about 115 lbs and the 2 petite is perfect in the legs and waist, but a little wide across the chest (i'm a 32c). the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality. it's perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and i'm going to think of ways to transition it to the f",4
"I bought the dress in navy stripe in december and it became a favorite, so i jumped at the opportunity to buy the ""blue"" (pink/purple/blue/black stripes) when it went on sale. this dress is very flattering and feminine, i love the fitted top, fitted sleeves with a cute button detail, and the asymmetrical hemline. i use the navy for work, whereas the colorful stripey one is fun on the weekends. it washes well and holds shape (i hang it to dry). i like it best with boots, but it would work with fl",4
It is the perfect shirt that looks and feels great. i wear a size 4 and it fits perfectly.,4

I purchased this blouse for an easter brunch and couldn't be happier! the feminine/romantic print is a gorgeous addition to my spring wardrobe. i've paired it with a pencil skirt and heels for a dressier look as well as my favorite ag cuffed denim and sandals for a more casual daytime look.,4
"The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. 
bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s",1
"Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me, so the size was good in this, too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short, but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black, too.",4
Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!,4
"This skirt is soft and comfortable, breathes and moves really nicely. great quality and fabric, just be careful in the first wear i snagged a spot with my rings. i ordered my usual medium, but probably could have sized down to a small. i plan to wear this all the time.",4
"This top's subtle golden shimmer from the metallic thread used in the detailing is really nice. flattering, a bit special, all in all nice. but the white is see through, and the green somehow reads much more casual, at least to me. so a good top for times when your top being sheer isn't such a big deal but probably not for the office.",3
"Great strapless maxi. purchased for a late august wedding being held at a yacht club, will fit the nautical theme perfectly.  i'm typically a size 8 and ordered the medium size -- fit is a little snug on top for my 34dd chest but waist and hips are spot on.  length is long, totally skims the floor for my 5'6"" height.  i plan on wearing it with red patent leather wedges so it'll help keep the hem off the floor and make me look longer.  quality is outstanding, strong zipper, quality fabric, excell",3
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe",1
"I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the ""flare"" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips.

that said, i found this perfect for me in every way. after having a baby, it's hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust. i wish this dress was a tad long",4
"This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love, love, love this dress!!",4
Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!,4
"Very unique, cute top. i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size.",4
I bought this yesterday in store in the red color. normally i wouldn't spend this much money on an everyday dress- but there was no way i could walk out of the store without it! the fabric and fit are amazing. the dress has a chic-ness about it that makes you look completely put together but doesn't make you look like you are trying too hard. perfect balance of comfort and style. i'm seriously thinking i need it in black as well!,4
I bought these in the navy stripe and they're soft and comfortable. i'm between a small and a medium and the medium works here -- i could not have worn a small in these. the narrow stripes make the pants flattering and the drape is lovely. i wish they had pockets but i guess i can't have everything!,3
This jacket is so adorable on! i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and it's hard to tell what it even looks like?! i've been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break. in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material. this definitely does not! it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality. the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater,4
Fit is tts and comfortable. the color didn't suit mine but if the color works for you then grab it because it's a beauty,4
"First off, these are great because they are not so tight like all other work out crops that my anatomy is not a mystery to people around me. i have an athletic build and these pants are awesome in that they hug the body lightly. they are so soft and comfy also. perfect for running and the gym and apres whatever. i bought a back up pair.",4
"I completely disagree with the previous review. i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it! i went out for a couple occasions (one being special and the other not so special) and both times i received compliments all night! my husband loves it and that really says a lot. i feel the dress runs true to size, and the quality is right where it should be... runway worthy... absolutely!.... worth $3000's + ?....probably not, but i personally can't afford that anyway. i'm so happy to have found th",4
"I bought these on a whim, patterned bottoms aren't normally my thing. i was pleasantly surprised. they fit well, look great and i had lots of compliments.",3
"I love love love the fit in the corduroy, so thought about grabbing these jeans as well. they fit much pretty well, just the color wasn't quite right. i'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans, and these don't quite match the coloring in the photo. still debating whether to keep them. love the cuff styling and straight leg fit!",3
"I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks, but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok, but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker, this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this, i wouldn't recommend.",2
"I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!",1
"First of all a caveat, i am not curvy at all. i am average height but petite in terms of features and bones and such. specifically, i am 5 feet 6 inches tall and about 123 pounds and boyishly shaped with a feminine and timeless style. all this means that i can get overwhelmed by dresses/clothes with a lot of fabric or large prints and such. if you are shaped like me, this dress will be perfect for you! it highlights your advantages (slim and petite) and give you curves (that i wish i had natural",4
"I thought this coat was absolutely unique when i first laid my eyes on it, i saw it on a co-worker on thanksgiving 2015, her coat was in navy blue pattern, mine was grey, but looked very good on and let me say the way she wore the coat, it looked oversize on her. my co worker is a very skinny size xs-s woman with very slim slender curve-less figure unlike mine. we are about the same height but i'm a bit taller with curves (6ft, 160lb). i normally wear size l 10. i like my outfits lose, but after",3
Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.,1
"Gorgeous material, great length for tall girls, warm without being too heavy, super soft. i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extra-small. i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year, not sure if its vanity sizing. this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple - elegant and sophisticated. the grey is that nice soft grey that doesn't wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions. great",4
"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.",4
"I knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought i'd give it a try. i wear a 36d and bought a large. it's got a clasp in the back so there's no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big. the triangles did not provide enough coverage, left too much side boob. the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy. sadly, have to return and cancel the back-ordered bottoms. i would recommend to someone",3
"So to put this in some perspective, when i tried on this dress for my husband after bringing it home, he described it as ""possibly the best dress you've ever bought."" so that's definitely a winner! i think what makes the dress great is that it's not clingy, but still had a good drape. on the skinny models, it looks large and flowy, but on my curvier body, it draped beautifully and is super flattering, without being clingy or too tight. i'm usually a size 10, 36ddd, and i sized down to a medium s",4
I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.,0
"This jacket is a great fit and feels like a nice, comfortable addition to a professional/work wardrobe. it is very lightweight and fits somewhat loosely. i am 5""7 and 125 lbs and the small fits nicely. the only con is that there is not a way to secure down the top payer of the wrap )no snap, button, etc.).",3
"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short.",0
"I was on my way out the door when i noticed this adorable t-shirt and of course i grabbed one and went to try it on. i love it, it's a different take on a t-shirt. it's comfortable and stylish. i ended up buying the white one and gold colored one. i'm even thinking about grabbing a couple more colors.",4
This sweater jacket is beautiful. the picture doesn't do it justice. works very well with a tank underneath and a skirt or over a knee length dress. wore with boots and received many compliments. it's classy.,4
"I loved this jacket the minute i saw it. saturday sunday is one of my favorite brands. even cuter on than the photo. short back at natural waist long in front . great quality fabric. thick and warm. fits very narrow in sleeves so i went from small to medium to have room for a top underneath. the medium is perfect. back is stylish, solid tweed grey with front pattern wrapped around from front. sleeves and collar a black diamond pattern and ribbon trimmed edge.overall very interesting grey black c",4
"I bought the ""here comes the sun"" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper.",4
"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'",4
"I have a closet filled with black lace dresses but this one is my new favorite!
the style is classic with an unexpected yet still elegant twist.
i ordered my usual size and found it to run a little on the small side, especially in the waist.
this is one dress you need to have in your closet.
if you are in between sizes i would suggest going up one size.",4
I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.,4
Bought (on sale) the first to use for working out/yoga and they're perfectly suited for the job! so i bought 2 more (also on sale). has held up well in the wash so far and i've washed each about 3-4 times. runs a little large but it is a loose flowy top. normally wear a medium but got smalls in these.,4
"I love this dress. it is super cute and comfy. i am 5'7 and a size small, 4 and 36c and i got this dress in a 4 and it fits great. a 2 might be a little more fitted on my waist but the 4 is comfortable and looks great. the length is perfect, not too short at all.",4
"Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item! 
however, the item came with unrepairable holes, not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad, but i still love retailer!!!",1
"I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large, i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress, for example, fits just fine in my regular size.) so, i ordered this dress in my regular size. well, i tried it on, and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit, even if i went up 3 sizes. it's crazy!
this is a terrible shame because it's really a lovely dress and it fits j",3
"I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it. i was a little unsure what the quality would be like just from the photos, but i went ahead and ordered it and it is even more amazing in person. it's super soft and well made. it's also very warm even though it has such a large open weave. the price is definitely higher than i would normally pay, but this is a piece that will stay in your closet, and wardrobe rotation for years and years. definitely worth the investment. i agree with the pre",4
"I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.",0
"As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it, and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back, has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings, but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights, but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com",4
"This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white, needless to say it went back.",0
"Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.
this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!",4
Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size,4
"My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile.",4
Beautiful dress that is easy to just throw on and go. i bought both colors. though it is loose it is still flattering. it has a good length and movement. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium as it is pretty loose fit.,4
"I just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off! in blouses i wear a size 6 (small or medium) with a 34b bust, tall and slender and i had to purchase a size 12 (what????).

overall so cute and could not pass it up. good luck. try it on before purchasing.",3
"As most have already commented, runs small in upper body. i'm always a 2 or 4 petite (5'1"", 120# max, 36aa, athletic build). the petite s was exceptionally small in upper body and no chance of it stretching enough to be comfortable. since i read other reviews before purchasing i also ordered the petite m. pm was too big under arms. i exchanged both and purchased a regular s in store. fits great, though would have liked it a mere 1"" shorter.
the sizing should have been 2,4, 6 etc.

"Just a cute, casual tee that i grabbed on sale, but i love the bow in the back! something unique for an otherwise plain tee!",3
"This is an amazing dress. beautiful fabric and color. comfortable too. it's like wearing air. sorta chameleon like because this print  literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on. it's slimming too. i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body. the back is completely open. it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view. the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer, which is slightly snu",4
"This dress runs so large, why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small, i was swimming in it, there was no way to fix it so it went back",1
"I have this sweater in ivory and raspberry. it's gorgeous. holds up well on had wash cycle also. it's so flattering. i'm so so happy i bought theses. i am 5'8"", athletic build and a normal medium, this runs large. i bough smalls.",4
Saw this in store and could hardly wait to try it on! the print is adorable and colors are vibrant. the material is heavier than i'd like for hot phoenix summers but decided to get it anyway. will be great for work. i noticed that there is a little more room in the chest area of this dress but not a deal breaker. seems to be well made in general and i love the pockets!,4
"Adore these jeans! great length, cute cuffed details. could do cartwheels in these :)",4
"I loved the material's texture and drape, but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees, but...) 

other than the see-through nature, i loved this shirt!",2
"This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy, comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.",4
This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.,4
"Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess.",1
"Yes these are a true clear red. not neon red or orange red, but a classic shade of red. these pants are so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. they are a nice weight for spring/summer without being too light or flimsy. they remind me of j crew martie but i like these better. i'd say they fit tts if not slightly on the large side. for reference my waist is 26 and hips are 35. the size 0 fits very well but the 2p were too big. ( i also take a 0 in the martie but those are slightly m",4
"I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall",4
This is such a lovely top. it is a bit sheer but i wear a cami under it. i wish it came in more colors because it is just so pretty!,3
I love this sweater. the green is soft. the fabric is light enough for year round in my area. i thought it might be too young but it works nicely for me. i bought it in two other colors when the package arrived today.,4
"I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.",1
"This dress fits and flatters a curvy silhouette. size medium length is perfect for my 5'7"" frame. utterly comfortable and so many compliments!",4
"I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine, but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips, so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all.",1
"Ugh. this skirt is beautiful and so well made, but i sized up to a 0 from my usual 00 based on reviews, and it's too large, and now my size is all sold out! if it were the right size it would fit beautifully! i'm pretty much a stick, (5'5, 105lbs) and it does poof out at the hips, making me look a little curvier, which might be an issue for some. but the quality is amazing, and this piece will spruce up most outfits !",3
"Oh how i dread online shopping for bikinis...especially bottoms. however, these bottoms are incredible. the fit is perfect. you know when you are wearing normal underwear and you ask yourself... ""why can't bathing suit bottoms just fit like this?"" these bikini bottoms do! you can't tell by the picture but they are a really great weight...not too thick and bulky...very flattering...perfect rear coverage...doesn't pinch your sides.truly the most flattering bottoms i've found in a long time. worth",4
"I love the way this t-shirt fits. the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest, but not too revealing. will look great with layered, dainty necklaces. the sleeves are nice and long - and i have long arms. the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer, but overall the design is nice. not too tight, not too loose. i'm 5' 5"" and 125 lbs - 34c and the small fits me well. fabric is medium weight - could be a little thicker. the brick color is nice and works great with",3
The dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath. it was just too big for me even as a swing dress.,2
"A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this, i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey, not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said, it's very pretty, i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder, and i'll give the xs a shot instead!",2
"I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.

Super easy date or work dress. it's a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit.,4
"These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a",4

These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.,4
"This tee is a great everyday staple.  it is comfortable and it also drapes very well.  i am 5ft 2in, 100lbs, 34b and i got this in xxs regular.  the length is perfect for leggings/skinny jeans, and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front. i have this is navy, green and black.  the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion, looks better.  you can't go wrong. planning on getting the grey and pink one as well.",4
"I have a gala to go to wear i am a board member. i had been eyeing this dress online and tried it in store! lurve! i got the black one which is a black lace over a sheer cotton nude, i also got the regular when i am petite as it hit longer for a black tie event. i have a large bust at 5'2"" size d, but small and short torso and the large just hugged the girls just right. i love the it can be worn fancy with block heels to a gala or wit ha jean jacket or espradilles for a casual summer night. this",4
"Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable, looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering, but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also.",4
As all the reviews say it is completely sheer. it's a very cute top other than that.,3
"Like the reviewers before me, this dress runs small in the rib cage. i normally take a 12 and am a 32b. the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12. it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top. there is no wiggle room in the dress. 

that being said, it is a really cute style and shape - rather like a 50's style dress if you will with a sexy back. i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure. however, because it is a fulle",3
This is a great top so beautiful with bright colors and sheen. my only complaint was i am dd and it was tight so i had to size up!  otherwise my brests would spill up and out!.,4
"Fits great. structured, but still comfy. figure flattering.",4
"So cute, warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood, for the win!",4

"Easter ??mother's day tea??baby shower??
i'm 5'2"" 120# and ordered a 4p. true to size. beautifully made, flowy, feminine. i can't wait to wear this!",4
This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.,4
This is an attractive shirt but runs big. i ordered the black and white.,2
"From the online pics, i would never think to try this on, but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets, so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up, almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.",4
"So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of ""flow"" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn't make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i'm not sure it wou",1
"I just bought this pretty dress at my local retailer after finally deciding to go in the store to try it on. once i saw it on display in the window in the lilac, i already knew i was going to try that one on and take it home though i really love both colors and prints. the dress fit me tts (sz 6, 34d-27-35) and looks absolutely adorable on! it's super soft, light weight but not so much that you don't feel it's worth the price and the design reminds me of the retailer i love. it has a wonderful vinta",4
"I thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case.
it is a pretty heavy, nice thick cotton and beautiful made. it does run large. i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5'9"" frame.

"These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs, so i don't think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze, and it's a very versatile color! darker than the picture, but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all",3
"I loved the swimsuit when i saw it online and it looks just a cool in person. however, i had to return it because the size large top was very very small. i wear a 34d bra. this top seemed like it would only work for an a or b cup size, even in the size large. cute suit for the right body, though!",3
"First, this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look. 
however, there are several items to note. primarily, this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.",2
"I've been eyeing this piece for a while and gave in when there was a sale. admittedly, i was first drawn away when i read that it was a pull on style, which always seemed cheap to me; however, it worked in my favor since the small was a tad big but the draw string helped cinch it (the store currently didn't have xs). the skirt, as shown on the model, seems like it'll be great as a transitional piece for autumn and winter (and when i tried it in the fitting room, i paired it with a cardigan and a",4
Beautiful design and perfect for warm days. it has a lovely open back with the perfect amount of loose fitting flow.,4
Tried this little number on in store...... i am 51 years old..... not a bad body.... gave this a shot. it looks minus my slightly wrinkled knees great ....and very close to what it looks like on model. very happy with one!!!,4
I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!,3
"This shirt is so soft and very flattering. i ordered the navy in a medium (5' 10"" 150 lbs). love how it scoops in the back.",4
"Amazing, beautiful dress that is very slimming and elegant, while casual. but it is only for smaller busted women! i have a medium and am a 34c - it's tight and pulls strangely. i've seen that comment elsewhere. i tried on the large and it was too big everywhere but the bust.",3
"Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way.",1
Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.,4
"I tried this on in the store. the embroidery is very nice and the shirt is very flattering. however, because of all the stitching, the shirt is a bit stiff on top. there is not much give. i am also concerned that after washing it, it will look terrible, so i passed.",4
"So, ordered online. tried this on, boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes. 
back it goes. super cute but huge.",1
"This is a beautiful top but the fit is odd. it's roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight. i wear a size 8 in all hd in paris tops but this one didn't fit anything like the others. i wouldn't even know what size to recommend because it's almost too big in the body, while being too tight in the arms. the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so i'm hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably. otherwise, it will be going back.",2
"Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try",2
"So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face, but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre. 

fit: 5'4"", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee",3
"I just couldn't resist the western scene and it doesn't disappoint. i ordered size large and although it's a bit long for me, it flows nicely over my hips. i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans. just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too. the fabric isn't thin or heavy. wasn't it goldilicks who said: it's just right! i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great,",4
"These beauties offer such sweet respite from low-rise skinny jeans -- hallelujah! absolutely love the high waist and elongated line. i'm 5' 7' and the 25 are a great fit. very slimming, and already i've dressed them down with an off-the-shoulder top and wedge espadrilles and dressed them up with a silk blouse and heels. the design is very retro-fabulous, the quality top notch. love these and look forward to having them as a ""forever"" staple in my denim repertoire. i've been searching far and wid",4
"Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest, this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!",0
This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!,4
"This dress is very clever. fabric is on thicker side so it eliminates any worries about dimples or imperfections. the tie at neck line is effortlessly sexy and not at all trashy as another reviewer felt. you could tie it if you didn't want any cleave, or leave it looser for more casual look. i got the small bc i felt comfortable with a little cling given how forgiving the fabric was. it still showed shape when i walked. i was surprised to like it as much as i did. husband insisted i get it becau",4
"I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it.",4
"What can i say? this is a winner! it is stunning, gorgeous, a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet. it is classic, early 1960s look, which is exactly my style! i am usually a 14 or a 16, so i went with a 16 based on the reviews, and it fits divinely. i don't need another orange dress, but this is a keeper!",4
"Skirt fit perfectly, nice construction - hidden zipper, full lining - nicely done. would love to see it in navy or black.",4
"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too",2
"I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!",4
"Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!",4
"The material is so soft, and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'1 #145 and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit, and a polished-casual look.",4
"I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater, like on the model, is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater, the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium, but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i",2
"This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess.  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable.  the dress is very fragile, handle with care.",4
"Purchased this tee online and could not be happier with what arrived in my mailbox. this tee is perfect to throw on to run errands or out to lunch. the fabric is so soft, fit is true to size, i don't like tight fitting shirts, if you do i suggest ordering down a size. overall great detail, fit and just as pictured!",3
"This shirt is very comfortable to wear, mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area, but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot.",4
I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....,4
"This sweater was in-store in a more neutral color palette and was so pretty. when i tried it on i noticed a few things: the versatility and quality are definitely there - this is a nice piece even at full-price. the downside is that it runs very large. i'm typically a 14/16 and a size xl in most retailer items, and even the large was a bit roomy. the other thing was that the sleeves of this sweater are pretty long (and i have long arms). due to the bell cut of the sleeve you couldn't even really c",3
"This top is even more beautiful and vibrant in person, but you definitely need a racerback cami underneath it as the laser cuts are big. the first time i wore it today, i got a number of compliments. a definite keeper.",4
"The material is nice and of good thick, quality. feels a bit stiff due to the lovely embroidery. unfortunately this top runs large and is not fitted at all. as the material is thick and stiff it does not drape well which makes for an unflattering look.",3
"Buy it. buy it right now! this dress is gorgeous, and would be on anyone. i don't care what size you are, it's so pretty, that you feel pretty in it! i loved wearing it, and since i am in florida, i can wear it all year long. so it's worth it. happy, very happy, with this purchase!",4
"It was lighter weight than i expected but that's perfect for me considering florida winters are mild. it's more like a wool sweater than coat. the design is gorgeous, however, ran bigger than anticipated. i'm hoping an exchange to the xs will work otherwise i'm not sure i can get the fit i expect from this sweater coat. the buttons are plastic and would have made a much bigger impact if they were wooden but they're still nice. overall i love it and am hoping for the right fit so i can flaunt thi",4
"I love this dress, i love the style, i love the pattern, i love the feel of the fabric. there's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me. however, i think it runs a little large, particularly because it's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature, and it's a great one: this dress (and your figure) needs it. i am 135 pounds, 5'5"", and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should've known to try a small, but i went with my usual size in dresses",3
"Loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge. i ordered a 2 and it fit me like an extra large. i am 5'2"" about 110 pounds and not flat chested.",2
I'm 5' 120 lbs. i'm posting a photo. one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over 40 crowd. i wore it was a cami under. see pic. it is comfy. it has pockets and fits beautifully. i ordered a 6petite. it's a little long on me. buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it.,4
"Nice soft jeans, cute style, and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need. 
if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type",2
"Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm? 

this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.",1
Love this top! it's light weight and very comfortable! it's great for wearing around the house or going out for a casual dinner. would love to get it in more colors!,4
"This dress is just absolutely adorable! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding, or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress! this dress does run a tad bit large - i'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me. best purchase yet!",4
"Swing dresses are the holy grail of comfort. whatever's going on underneath doesn't matter because you're all arms and legs and billowy fun and this dress doesn't disappoint. beautiful, light and silky fabric with a pattern and color palate that can easily work all spring, summer and into the fall with some layers. a great, unique dress!",3
"I love this dress! it's cotton, but thicker/ higher quality. i'm going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer, and it's thicker material, so i won't even have to wear a bra with it ! it's a little lower cut, so be careful. i'm 5'3 and the extra small hits me right above my ankle",4
I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's,4
"I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on, not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric, but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants, and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store, i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are",2
"I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side, but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i like the regular size because the l",2
"Love these leggings. great fit, great look. perfect with boots and oversized sweater. bought a couple of different fabrics. highly recommend.",4
"This dress is beautiful and i received so many compliments. it's form fitting but comfortable. it is just the right mix of classy and sexy. you can easily dress it up for a formal occasion or keep it simple. i am 5'6"", 150lb with an athletic build and a size 8 fit perfectly. i will be wearing this dress for years to come.",4
I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it,2
"I really, really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however, it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress, i can't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.",2
"I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise. this sweater, like the one i purchased last season by the same designer, is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft (like cashmere soft). am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it!",4
"This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)",4
This t is very cute and comfortable. could be worn casually or dressed up a little bit with jeans.very cute pattern on the shoulder area. love this top!,4
"I really did want to love these jeans but i had to return them. 
im a size 10 and a little heavier in the thighs and got a 30. the rise is just to high for me and the thigh was very tight. 

the denim felt fabulous they just fit me a bit funky.",3
"This is a beautiful dress with gorgeous details but it is not as long as it appears in the photo. i am 5'9""and ordered an xl. the dress comes just below my knees.",3
"I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low, this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat",4
"Absolutely adore this dress. details, fabric and deep pockets. here is the caveat at least for me. i am a typical size 6 and ordered the dress in a size 8 for a little looser, casual fit. the 8 is so small i can barely place over my shoulders and cannot button. i have reordered a size 12 and 14. perhaps the dress i received is not tagged properly. so disappointed as the item is on backorder.",4
Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!,4
"I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u",4
I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.,4
I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.,2
"I love this dress. i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut, weight and quality. i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom (unless really high heels). i am 5'5"", so i would say that it runs long. offer this cut in more colors!!",4
"I loved this blouses when i saw it on-line, but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different. it runs really large and i didn't like the material of blouse.",4
"I am a huge fan of pilcro pants, and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front, fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however, i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly, these had to go back :(",2
"I discovered this top folded on a shelf and loved the material and this brand so i decided to try it on... even though it's super hot right now in ar. i'm so glad i did and ended up finding the other color and buying both. i am 5'9"", 127#, 34b and long waisted. it is difficult to tell in the pictures how this top fits around the waist... it is snug fitting but the material is thicker so i feel like it's very flattering. i tried it on as a boat neck look, then saw online it was off the shoulder a",4
"This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down, with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4,124 lbs, broad shoulders, with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer, a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine.",4
I like this top. it fits nicely. the knit is thicker than i though it would be t but i still like it.,3
"After reading the reviews, i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me. 
i'm 5'4"", 126 pounds and generally wear a size small, but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much, and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering.",1
"I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy, but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.",4
Beautiful airy well made blouse. very flattering and feminine. i normally wear a size 8 and ordered a 10 per the other reviews and i am glad i did! the fit id perfect.,4
"This top is soft, flattering, modest enough to wear to work, but subtly sexy (and i'm amply endowed at 36d). i just wish i'd gotten one in every color.",4
"Love this sweater! it's really flattering, long and lean, though not tight, just the right amount of shape and length for my size. i run between and 8 and a 10, and i'm about 5'8"", i ordered the medium. i love the contrasting knits of the sleeves and body of the sweater. i only wish it came in more colors, i'd order it again!",4
"I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself! it is a cotton/polyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear. the length fits nice as well. i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans! thank you for making an item that is both pretty, flexible, and meets the needs of young women (and their moms!)",4
This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.,0

This sweater is very nicely made...i got a lot of compliments the first time i wore it. it's a light sweater and looks great with jeans! love it,4
This sweater is very comfy and looks great with tighter leggins. beautiful color,3
"This dress is so soft, flowy and comfortable! the material is very smooth and silky. i'm hoping it holds up well over time with washing. i am 5""5, 120lbs and i ordered a xs. the elastic waist is a tad tight but otherwise it fits perfectly - just as shown on the model in terms of length and how the top fits. i said it runs a large because normally i would order a s but i think if i did, it would be too long and the arm holes might be too big.",4
"I was a little hesitant to order this, thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up, ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and went with the size 4 regular",4
"I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring, summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it, also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details.",4
"Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.",1
"This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.
it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.",1
"I like this sweater very much. it's short but not too short, and soft but not fluffy. the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors (i ordered the tan) are great for me, a redhead. i'm 5'3"", 125 lbs and don't like clingy tops so i took a m and it's perfect. really cutewith jeans.",4
"This reminds me of a kimono or poncho rather than a ""cardigan"" but that aside its a beautiful sweater. the feel of it is luxurious and is soft and comfortable. i would size down at least one size. i'm usually a medium to large and i bought the small. i gave this piece 4 stars because it is a touch boxy. it's seems like a piece i'll throw on with jeans and wear to a casual dinner in the fall. definitely a fall/winter item.",3
"Not great quality, runs a bit lose, disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area)",1
"This sweater is perfect with leggings, crop pants, jeans and wide leg pants. a line, 3/4 sleeves, does not cling to waist area... very flattering. so soft , comfortable and thick cotton knit... no cami required. length is bum covering.",4
"I'm in love with this dress and first tried on the petite size in the store. if you don't have enormous shoulders (which i do) , i think the petite would fit someone in the 5'6"" range. what i'm trying to say is the dress is pretty long. the cut is beautiful and patterns perfectly complementary. i've been reading marie kondo's book and this one ""sparks joy""!",4
"I'm a 5'7""and curvy, these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!",4
"I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit",4
Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color,2
"I love the way this top fits! i am busty on top and smaller on bottom, and it really flatters. it's funny to see it called ""off the shoulder"" b/c so far i have worn it on the shoulders. when worn on the shoulders, the neck is very flattering, kind of like a cowl neck. i probably would not wear it off the shoulder b/c of the whole bra strap challenge. i got the charcoal color which looks great with jeans or black leggings.",4

"Buy this dress! you won't be disappointed. it's lovely and can be worn in the summer and easily transition to fall or even winter with opaque tights, tall boots, and a denim jacket. the neckline is unique and stunning - demure yet sexy - something that can easily be worn during the 9-5 work day or into the evening. i bought my regular size m and it hits just about my knees. i don't think this dress runs small at all.",4
"Hi, i love this top. it not only is femine but it is wee bit sexy. it could be worn in the office then out for happy hour",4
"I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).",0
This dress is even better in person! the attention to detail and craftsmanship are amazing. i received compliments all night from total strangers.,4
This dress fits incredibly well. i loved the color and it will transition through the fall nicely.,3
I would buy these pajamas in every color if offered. they feel wonderful to the touch and even better on!,4
"This is my third velvet by graham and spencer dress and i was not disappointed in the least... i love the fabric, how it can be dressed up or down, worn with a wide variety of footwear and is comfortable at the same time. the fabric is breathable and i can definitely see this becoming something i will throw on with a simple necklace, leather jacket and sneakers or boots on the weekend for errands around town, then be able to switch out my shoes for drinks in the evening. it's a simple back dress",3

The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!,4

"I so wanted to love the striped peplum top, however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)",1
"I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size), i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it, then decided that was crazy. disappoin",1
I am usually an xs but ordered an xxs in this because it looked like it ran large. glad i did. it's still roomy but doesn't look too big. could be a swim cover-up or would look cute with jeans. very pleased.,4

This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!,4
"I ordered this in blue, and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style, but i tried a few items on my last order, this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom, which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style, this item is good quality, soft, comfortable material, and a great spring or fall blue.",2
"These are soft, silky, and super comfortable, the fit is very flattering, especially with muscular legs. beautiful pattern and colors, fit like a glove. however, unfortunately, they felt like pj pants, i know they are beach pants, but they were pretty see-through. for the price, i decided to return and wait for potential sale... 
ps i needed heels as they are long if you usually get petite.",3
"I loved this dress and purchased it in my usual m. however, i agree with another reviewer that it is too long for me at least, so i returned this and will buy it in petite instead. if you are shorter (i'm 5'2), the regular length doesn't fall right, the shorter front section falling right at the knee and the longer section falling halfway on my calf . but great style! looking forward to seeing it on me in the petite.",3
"I really like this. it's not too baggy and not tight. it drapes nicely. and the pattern is a bit dainty without being frilly.
i love this blouse.",4
"Size 8 always, 36c and i have broad shoulders...i found this true to size. the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert, just letting you girls know. this is very figure flattering, especially with my body frame, it accentuates the right spots.",4
My only reservation is that i wish the tail wasn't so much longer than the front. i returned it reluctantly because i needed something just a little dressier for the occasion.,3
"These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day. they fit true to size and are very flattering. i have 5 pair. they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after work!
love them",4
"I know it's for warm weather, but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought 2 sizes a 4 & 6, because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me, but the boxy cut of the 4 left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath.",4
"I love this black turtleneck. arms are a little long, so should have gotten small. i wore it and love it! you can play with collar and snaps; up or down.",4
"I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers, i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress, which is not easily noticable in the web photos, and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.",4
"I am 5' 8"", 145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore, i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however, the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore, i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j",2
Nice twist on a basic t-shirt. pictures don't tell the full tale. better in person. bought the cream one. loving it.,3
"This blouse is so beautiful and feminine. it fits loosely and is see thru, so you do need to wear a cami underneath it. it is very comfortable to wear. i got many compliments when i wore this blouse. all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it. however, be extra careful when you do wear it. i'm still not quite sure how it happened, but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it. it's so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w",4
"Dress is wonderfully made. the fabric is soft and the print is beautiful.wonderful detail,especially the ties.  nice lining...not see thru at all.
mid calf length looks good with heels or flats.
lovely dress for a sunny day or an evening out!!",4
"This top is a lot more striking in person. on, it's quite stunning. it is a tad short but that's part of the aesthetic and i don't find it unflattering. however, the first time i wore it one of the black rope/thread details disintegrated and fell apart. i tried to reinforce the end and reattach it but it just came apart again. i understand the nature of the top makes it more delicate, but this was definitely disappointing. i mentioned it when i went back into the store and the sales girl sympath",3
"This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work, so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.",2
"Fell in love with these instantly in the dressing room. it was more than i wanted to spend but i don't regret it. quality is great, denim is just the right thickness, i love the wash... will be wearing these a lot. just like my other pilcros!  i'm 5'8"" 125 lbs. size 28 fits perfect and the length is just right.",4
"Great fabric and nice cut - like other reviewer said, fitted but not too....but it was just too short for my legs. i do wonder if the description is wrong but i didn't keep it long enough to measure and check this.",4
"I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft, it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both, although they were true to size",0
"Love this top! it hits at the top of the waist & is very flattering. the fabric is thicker than i thought it would be and had a deep texture. when i first took it out of the package, i thought it would be a ""send-back"" because it looked kind of square & shapeless. but once on, it took on a whole other look.",4
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much,0
"Gorgeous sleeves, flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much, i decided to buy it, knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture, i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh",2
Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash.,1
I love this top and bought my usual xs. i don't have any issues with the buttons gaping but am 34b so i'm not a busty girl. i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter.,4
My friend and i bought the same dress we love it so much we get so many compliments great purchase,4
"I really like this top.  for reference, i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large, however, in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer, my usual size is m as i am 36d bust, 132 lbs., 5""5.",4
"Best dress ever maeve does it again! tts and can be worn all 3 seasons here in sacramento 
love it and can be worn with a denim jacket or cardigan!",4
This pair of flare is just what i have been searching for. the color is a nice vintage blue. i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size.,3
I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy. it did not look flattering and will be going back.,1
"Absolutely lovely! even better in real life. this is not your typical cheap, flimsy dress. this is quality! the fabric is interesting, the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering. pay attention to the length ? there are miles of fabric in that fortuny-esque skirt and the model is very tall. i am 5'5"" and slim, and ordered petite small, and it's a little longer on me than it is on the model. i don't mind. i've been looking for a special-occasion dress for a long time and knew this was it",4
"Good job retailer for getting the color representation spot on! the blue is so vibrant and the cashmere knit is so soft and comfortable. the dress is oversized but a little too much so. i recommend sizing down to get that ideal slouchy drape, otherwise you may overwhelm your frame with too much fabric.",4
"1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.

2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.

3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.

4. very polyester with lots of static.

5. cute idea, but not very good in pe",0
I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size,4
"This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling, color, fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.
the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.",2
"I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me, this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me, especially at this price point.",2
I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish,2
"These are nice, flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are",3
"Reviewers may be right that this skirt runs large but it fit well on my waist. it does not come in petite so petite buyers should be aware that it will be more of a midi than a knee-length skirt. it is adorable. i love it especially for its whimsical design of birds, and the colors are deep and lovely with the red popping out more than it does in the picture.the fabric is heavy but there is a slight give to it, which helps with the waist. it's a keeper.",3
This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.,4
I love this blouse. i wasn't sure if i was going to like the high neck but it fits the style. the quality is excellent. i bought a size small and i wear a size 2-4 or xs-s in retailer most of the time. i could have worn the xs if i was a little smaller busted (34c). i'm 5'9 and i didn't like where the gathering hit with the xs. very flowy without looking like a maternity top. it's also lightly lined so i don't have to wear a cami. warning - this shirt is long. if you are on the short side you may,4
"These pants are flattering and comfortable, plus they are cute, cute, cute. i'm a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top, but with a solid black or ivory/off white top they are perfect. can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or ""girlfriends'"" lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck. highly recommend",4
"This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however, when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition, though i ordered a size medium, it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad, i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are, go for it, but get a size smaller than you normally would!",1
"I bought these pants online in blue, and loved them so much that i bought them in the bronze two days later. very flattering fit, comfortable, great quality, and i look and feel like a class act wearing them. they're a bit of a looser taper style of fit, but that's just the style, and i've received so many compliments on them!",4
"The ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath. the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture. hope it washes well. maybe size up if you want a looser, relaxed feel. hits me right around the hip bone and i am 5' 8"". can easily be dressed up or down with accessories.",4
"I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist, in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity, even in a petite xs, so it's going back.",2
"I am fortunate to work in an environment where i can wear jeans just about every day. so, i am always looking for a good pair to add to my collection. i bought this style on a relatively quick shopping trip with not a lot of thought. well, 2 weeks later i was back buying a second pair.

the color is great, a little darker with that warn in look but no whiskering with a fit that is tts. i like the higher waist to cover my mommy-tummy and my butt looks pretty fabulous. but, the best thing about th",4
"I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.",1
"I was very patient with this dress. i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale. when i tried my usual 6 size it was way too tight but i could zip it. ( i am 5'6'' 145 lbs). the dress covers my knees and it's a perfect length, so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so it's a work friendly. it has side pockets, which can be very comfortable as well. the cut is great, it's a line,the thickness of material makes belly look great (in case if you care). i also like color a",4
"I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.",2
I got size 2p. it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it. i have a small chest about 32b and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top. i do have a shorter torso. i feel like i could've gone with the 0 petite. i'm a pear shape and more like a size 4 on the bottom and i weigh about 115lbs- there is tons of room to go smaller - it is not form fitting on the bottom at all. has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick,3
Soft and sweet,4
I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.,0
I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.,1
"I really love everything about this cardigan. the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot, the color is highly versatile, it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm, and my favorite part is that it is long. i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans. the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan, likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to",4
"I fell in love with this skirt at the store, but was concerned i wouldn't have enough to wear with it. i ended up purchasing it online and when it arrived found that it goes with so many things. black turtleneck as pictured, navy blue blouse with bird print, white t-shirt, white blouse, the options are endless. fits true to size. too short to wear to work but will be perfect for spring and summer weekends. can't wait for the weather to warm up.",4
"Love this skirt because of the colors, the unique style, and for a knit skirt i'm very impressed that it maintains shape throughout the day. great skirt to own. received several compliments. had to size up from a 2 to a 4. 28"" waist and 36"" hips. the size 2fit snugly and not very appropriate for work, but great for a night out. the size 4 is still form fitting, flattering and work appropriate. very comfortable going up a size without compromising the form fit.",4
"I just love this top, it has a flattering cut, fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!",4
"Just as breathtaking in person . . . and in a totally comfortable, soft, stretch fabric. i'm 5' 8"" 120 lbs. 34b; purchased the size 0 and 2 for comparison; decided on size 2 as the size 0 was really tight in the chest area--meant only for the tiniest! the dress is long on me and i'll likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the knees--but i'm grateful it's too long (something i can fix) rather than being too short.",4
"Love these socks!!! i need to get more colors, they look so good on with boots with the lace showing!",4
"This is a beautiful shirt. dressy, imo. it's tts, i would not size down in this shirt. can wear w/ black, white, moss, khaki, jeans, etc... love it.",4
"I am short (5'3"") and very curvy. i usually get petite in dresses. something about this fit was strange. it was definitely a little shorter than most petites. the lace detail on the front of this dress is really cute and it is a color you don't see often so i kept it.",3
"These pants are so comfortable, it's ridiculous. they are lightweight and perfect for spring/summer at the office or an evening out. i am 5'9"" and the pants fit as pictured. i paired with a sweater and kitten heels. they do run a little large so consider going down a size.",4
This dress is stunning! the quality is impeccable and the craftsmanship is stunning. i ordered my typical size and it was snug but sizing up would not have worked. this may be the most beautiful high quality piece i've ever seen at retailer!,4
"This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester, and it is, but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large, so go a size smaller than you would normally, and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester, why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth",3
"This is a beautiful, richly-colored top. fits well. very pleased. only negative is the button is covered in same material & can be easily nicked with your fingernail.",3
"Love this sweater! i purchased both the green and gray versions and will wear them constantly this winter. although some reviews were critical of the feel of the yarn, i do not find this to be a problem... so happy with these products! for reference to size, i bought the m and am 5'11... the sweater hits me exactly where it does on the model.",4
"I am 5'4"" and the regular sweater i tried in the store was too long. i ordered the petite online and it is perfect! it's warm and comfortable and can be worn different ways which makes it great for stretching my wardrobe. love it!",4
"I received this today and will have to send it back. it is super cute and the quality is great. however, you need to wear a bra or a halter bra due to the style which is not a proble, but my 32d chest looked huge in this top so it is going back.",3
"These pants are a life saver. i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink, rolled in a towel, and hung dry with good results. picro does not usually fit me well, these pants are the exception. i'm 5'6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length. great for a baseball game!
i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them!!!!",4
I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!,4
"The title says it all. while the quality was good, when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5""), which was ok, but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs, which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!",1
"This was huge on me! otherwise i thought it was a nice top, slimming. i didn't bother looking for another size, though. i got a medium. i wear a small or medium.",2
"I'm wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute, but doesn't get in the way. it's great for casual or casual work wear.",4
The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but,3
"This dress is so pretty in person. the colors are great - the blue and green and just beautiful in person. the fit is tts. i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has, but really it doesn't need it. it is super flattering even without a belt. i am just a hair shy of 5'5"", and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor. but adding a 2 1/2"" wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor (no hemming needed). i don't usually pay full price, but i am glad i did in this case.",4
I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.,2
"These undergarments are comfortable, streamlined, and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first, but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable.",4
This is a beautiful warm cardigan! just from the picture thought it was going to be longer. bought to wear with leggings but can't. i will wear it with jeans skirts and dresses. i am 5 feet 7.,3
I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes.,3
"I can't wear this without getting dozens of compliments. plus, it's comfortable! it's very soft. it is perfect with skinny jeans and boots, with pants, or with skirts. i have paired it with pretty much everything in my wardrobe. everyone wants to know where i got it! it's very well made and the embroidery is well done. it doesn't look like it is going to come undone anytime soon.",4
"I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it's still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.",1
"I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors!",4
"These are excellent. as previous reviewers noted, they are a thin material, and there isn't much stretch. that being said, they have a casual, work-appropriate men's wear vibe (the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this). if you really don't like the extra fabric, wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem. the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site, just fyi--it's less easy to mistake for black, which is alright in my book.",4
Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.,2
"This top is just as pretty in person as it is online. i usually buy petites, but ordered this one in the regular length and i'm glad i did. perfect on me at 5'2"". my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too. love their fabric choice as well. i'm getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now. deletta made my day once again!!!",4
I have been looking for a cuddly yet nice looking sweater like this one for a long time. i love anther as they always deliver what i am looking for.,4
"I'm on the shorter (5''3"") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly, i returned it.",1
"Beautiful color for fall. sleeves are a bit long and loose, but otherwise a great blouse for work. i recommend sizing down",3
"As in the other review, this dress runs small. i'm usually an 8 but it was tight and short. i would love to exchange for a 10 but it's out of stock. the beading and the colors on this dress are breathtaking...i was so disappointed it didn't fit! the background is more taupe/nude than cream which i actually really like.",3
I absolutley love this sweater. is is very cozy and warm and can be paired with many different outfits. i am upset i didn't get one in every color!,4
"I love the colors of this top. it does run very large though. when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top, not fitted at all. the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric. will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind.",2
"I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights, but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday, and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink, but from an arm's length away or more, it looks beige wi",4
Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,2
I'm so in love with this skirt. i sized up to a 4 (i'm typically a 2 in maeve) and it's pure perfection. i had to steam it after getting home from the store because it wrinkled up pretty quickly. wore it with my copper birks and a chambray top but i can see this being dressed up for work as well. took off a star due to his easily it wrinkled.,3
Color and style was pretty but the sleeves were so long i had to return it. cuffing the sleeves wasn't an option because you would lose the cute piping detail and see the inside seam.,3
"I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. 


fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. 

i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t",0
"Just picked this up in black in the store. on the hanger it looks like just another v-neck tank, but it is quite flattering on. however, the v-neck is quite exaggerated and loose, i will be pinning it so it doesn't sag open. :)",3
"I have other stevies, and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist, approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally, the cuff is sewn like that in place, and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like, a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!",0
"I love these jeans. i am normally a 25 so i went with a 25 petite. i'm 5'4"" and the length was perfect. the 25 was a little big so i'm going to order the 24 petite and compare. they r a great material and very stretchy",4
"Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those ""special"" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated.
the details are great, too. of course the embroidery is beautiful; but there are a couple more fun details. the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons; so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once. when the cuff is r",4
"I usually wear a s petite so that's what i initially got in this. i'm 5'2"", 32c-27-36. the shoulders were about an inch too wide on either side, the sides along the top had tons of extra fabric (almost like batwings or a dolman cut) and the waist was at least 6"" too big! i'm re-ordering in petite xs and hoping for the best, because this is a gorgeous coat.",4
I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer,4
"I ordered this top in red. gorgeous color and detail, however just wasn't flattering on my more curvy shape. felt like it looked like a maternity top.",2
"I don't usually write reviews, but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online. the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white. it gives the appearance of a separate crop top. i would usually wear a small (5'2"" and 125 lbs.). i'm wearing a small in the photo, but ended up going back for an xs. the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf, or dressier with heels and jewelry. i think i'll get a lot of use out of it.",4
"This cute dress has a built in slip, so no need for a slip . i think it has a flattering fit and the colors are pretty!
i feel like i could wear this dress to a shower, out to dinner, or just for a fun look to shop on a nice day!",4
"This cardigan/sweater/jacket is splendidly soft, wonderfully warm and super stylish. i wear it with a navy pencil skirt or leggings. this piece will be timeless.",4
Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.,4
"I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!",4
"I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!",0
Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!,4
"I love this dress so much, very detailed and comfortable. looks great with the pilcro vest.",4
When i saw this top.... i had to have it.....runs very small... would size up especially if curvy on top.......sheer but not too sheer...... feels and looks delicate...... no problems so far,3
"I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type, which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame, but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress.",4
"I got this in the petite length, size o, and it fit just right. i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap, and really needs to be concealed with a belt, yet because it sits so high, literally right under the bustline, it's a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th",3
"These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion, they run big. i am usually a small (4-6), 31"" waist, 38"" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend, but with a longer tank or shirt, they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far, wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9"" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea",3
This t-shirt is uniquely designed and it fit well. unfortunately within an hour it shed all over. i had white fuz all over my arms and pants. i was very disappointed.,2
"This casual top is adorable! a great top for jeans, linen pants or shorts! it would be cute with skirts too. 
i love the heavy feel of the fabric. too many fabrics today are thin and/or clingy. this is soft, but is substantial. it works well on my body-type. tall, thin, without much figure. it's not cheap, but something i'll likely keep for a few years.",4
"My normal size 32 fit tts. the length is great (i'm 5'9). i love the button detail on the bottom, makes them a little unique.",4
"I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute, having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings, seaside strolls, chilly restaurants, or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.",4
"I have never purchased printed pants before, but i was so smitten with the cute little shells that i had to try them on. i was impressed with the fabric, which has some thickness to it but will still be perfect for summer. i also have athletic calves and unlike other cartonnier pants i've tried, i had no trouble getting these over my legs! win win! i'm usually a size 8 and while it was fitted (not loose like on the model) i know they will stretch. being 5'4'' i'm just on the boarder of having mo",4
"Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you don't need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband's christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a",4
"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"", 115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th",1
"This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online. it's so flattering, it fits like a dream, and i love the fabric. i love that the skirt is a true a-line, not poofy, so it's sleek, slimming and flattering. the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy, while still being classy. oh, and the length, perfection! not too long, not too short. i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to. i am a curvy size 4 and it fits perfectly true to size. i couldn't be hap",4
I love this cozy jacket. i wanted a neutral colored jacket for casual outings. this does fit true to size. i am 5' 2'' and 105 pounds. i purchased the xs. you can cuff the sleeves to shorten the length of the arms. it has a piping so it doesn't look odd if cuffed. i do find most things/brands at retailer run big on me but not this item.,4
"Very nice casual corduroy skirt for the fall. it sits nicely at the waist and the asymmetrical cut gives it some visual interest. it has a slightly a-line shape and the side seams round up a couple of inches. i took a point off for it not being lined, and the closure relies on the zipper alone instead of having a hook along with the zipper. i took my usual small and like how it fits. my only concern is that it is a little on the short side for me but since it's a fall skirt and will always be wo",4
"This is a cute work jacket, as well as paired with jeans.  flattering. very soft.  only con is this is thick with a soft cotton lining, so not great for summer in az, but will get plenty of use this fall. typically 6-8 on the top, i went with medium.  not tight in the arms as other reviewer noted.",4
"I purchased this online and absolutely love this:::: it can be dressed up or down. i received many compliments, its also so soft and very comfortable!!! a must have!!",4
"Don't be put off by the sparkle! this jacket is amazing. lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches. i love this retailer in house brand, elevenses. i take a medium in this brand( 8/10) and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer. i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small -small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small. but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel. i have a 34 dd chest as reference. i plan to wear this in spring",4
"I am an retailer employee, i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store. they both loved the piece before they tried it on...the jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer. the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives. the lining is to short makes it feel awkward. i ordered the xxs petite, and it fits perfect, except the inside l",4
"Another winner for me! this top drapes wonderfully, the lace is beautiful and looks fabulous on! i would highly recommend it!",4
"The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace.",2
"I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality, especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great, but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.",1
"Overall, this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece, and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print, and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things, i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some, if not all, of the straps. other than that, i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else",4
"I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out (and i see it's now back in stock!). the quality of the fabrics is outstanding, not flimsy at all. the top is stretchy. normally i would wear a 2 at retailer, but the only choice i had was 0 and it fit. i am 5'5"" tall, 125 lbs. everything about this dress makes me smile and i can't wait to wear it to my holiday party! don't hesitate if you are on the fence.",4
"Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,",0
Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).,3
"These are a bit oversized, order a size down. they are a nice weight and look great under tunics.",3
"Bought this dress for a friend's wedding. i have since worn it to two others and the opera numerous times. it's my favorite little black dress as it's sexy and modest at the same time. i receive numerous compliments every time i wear it! it's easy to get into, the zipper is sturdy and the fabric is breathable, stretchy but not clingy.",4
"I absolutely love the way this skirt looks and fits. i have a smaller waist and larger hips so it is hard to find a pencil skirt that fits, but this skirt fits great! the material has some stretch to it but is still thick and looks really nice. the colors are beautiful, i bought it in the ""red"" which is really just multi-colored. i want it in the green now, too!",4
"I love the mustard color and fun boho details of this shirt, however the sizing was a little weird. i ordered the small petite first and it was just too short (which is rarely a problem i have), so i ordered it in the regular small. it's perfect in length, but a little loose on top, which i'm fine with. overall, very happy with this purchase and have received many compliments on it.",4
"This is a very appealing and flattering tee! the details really make this quite lovely: the back pleat makes the fit fabulous and motion ideal, the stitching at the neckline is attractive and artistically pleasing, the proportions are balanced, nothing too full or tight. although the tee is 100% cotton, the pocket is 100% polyester, quite silky and a nice accent. i bought the ""white"", which is more of an ivory and gorgeous, with complementary deeper ivory stitching. my usual medium fits great (s",4
"I ordered this on line. pretty, but ran large so returning. i am 5'10"" and 140lbs., not large chested, and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft, loose, knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price.",2
"I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't, the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.",2
"Perfect for work or a night out. packing for europe, wore it out on a saturday night with leggings and heels. layer it after yoga got it in all colors love",4
I bought this dress in burnt orange for my 19 year-old collage daughter. she loved it and has found many opportunities to wear it on campus. she said it is so comfortable and perfect with a sweater for cool fall mornings and sleeveless as the day warms up.,4
"I just bought this dress in the store and i absolutely love it except for one thing. why are the sleeves on the actual dress so much shorter than the picture with the model? i suspect the model has long arms, not little t-rex arms, so why does the sleeve hit at the top of her wrist, while my lovely dress hits just past my elbow. it's a mystery. was the pictured item not what the store took delivery of? anyway, still a great dress, just trying to figure out if i should add lace or something to ma",3
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! love, love, love! i am 5'2 and the petite sizing was perfect.",4
"This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk, but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high, almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it, the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo",2
"So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug, so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!",3
"Now i would've been scared off by the fabrics had i not seen the cute, flattering cut if this spring top. love the futuristic look of the fabric and style brought back by the rise design throughout. like the previous reviewer claims, this top is even cuter on us non models (who are pry not as washed out). the color combo is another positive because it's both flattering and versatile!",4
This dress is very well made. the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party. i do not think the arm openings are too large at all.,4
"I love this dress. as a petite woman, it's hard for my to find maxi-dresses that aren't terribly long and that cut in the right places. this dress fits perfectly! i love the slits in the side that allow for a flowy look and make it easy to walk around. there is also an elastic band that helps the materials over the bust stay in place along your torso. if you a bustier person like myself, it will likely cut in just under your bust line as opposed to as your waist like on the model. since i am bus",3
Purchased this top in navy blue. it is versatile. appropriate for the office and to go out. i specifically like the look with white jeans. it looks put together. the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design. highly recomnend it.,4
This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.,4
"I love this blouse. it is soft and has nice drape. even though it is very voluminous on the bottom, the true-to-size cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming. thinking about buying more prints!",4
"I purchased the blue s (140lbs, 5'8"", 34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however, although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it), it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but, again, thin and unlined. i think that, even on sale, this is ov",1
"I love this top. the design is very good, i love the pleats at the back, and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l, which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style, with fitted pants it would work well.",3
"I immediatley bought this adorable dress after trying it on at my local retailer and absolutely love it! it fits tts for me in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it's incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. the top portion is so great as it has nice short sleeves, the color is a nice deep, rich orange which looks great now in the summer but will look especially cute in the fall with tall boots and a light denim jacket plus the bottom half is cut in such an interesting way. the material is amaz",4
"I bought this dress online because it looked interesting and on sale for $30 why not. i think it looks unassuming on the hanger but on it is fantastic. i am 5' 3"", 150 pounds, 34d and the 8 fit me perfectly. it accentuates the curves without revealing anything. will be perfect for fall/winter but am going to wear it to a wedding in june where the bride is a vintage loving person so i think with the right shoes and jewelry it will be perfect.",3
"I love this top! it's very delicate and pretty. flattering cut. the fabric is sheer, so wear with a cami or a pretty bra.",4
"This is a fairly high quality tank which i purchased in blue-green. it's narrower at the top, more voluminous at the bottom and a heavier knit than i expected, so i'm a little concerned about stretching over time, but i'll be careful washing it and enjoy it till that day does (or doesn't) come.",3
"Cute dress, runs small, especially in the sleeves and chest (i usually wear a 0 and purchased a 2). the outer layer is very sheer and while the print and shape are cute, the quality could be better, especially for the price.",3
"This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty!",4
"So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~",0
"I had to order this dress three times to get the correct size. ordered a petite which worked great. i really like the dress now that i found the size that fits best. love the color! perfect for so many occasions, church, special events and dinner out. great with flats and wedges. i know i will be wearing it lots this summer. did i mention i love the color! worth repeating.",3
"This dress looks beautiful on. it's very flattering and comfortable to wear. it runs true to maeve's dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear. on my 5'3"" height the regular was just above the knee. great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you don't have it naturally !",4
"I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11"" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs, the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally, this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas, and the waist tie ties way higher than",2
Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....,3
"I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed",0
I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.,3
"This dress is very, very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest! it is pretty long, coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons! i would say that the quality is not 100% there, it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it. i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat! it is a perfect summer dress and i can't wait to wear it!!",4
"I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful, but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short, but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it, i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size, and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still",2
I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,0
"This is an amazing top. fits perfectly, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors, but unfortunately it's only in navy. don't hesitate to buy this!",4
"Love this tee! the fit is true to size, and very flattering shaping. not too tight, not too baggy, good length. i love the stitching detail on the top. the material is thick enough that you are not forced to wear a cami under it. my only concern is that it says to hand wash, dry clean acceptable. i have had some bad luck with retailer tops shrinking. i'm not going to risk it and dry clean it. normally i would not want that expense or hassle.",3
This is a great blouse for all shapes!   you can wear it under a suit or with jeans!,4
"I'm pretty flat-chested (34aa) so it's hard for me to say how the sizing runs on this top for others. to me, it's a slim fitting but not tight, true to size t-shirt. i tried the xs regular (dressing room photo) and the small petite (other photo) and i'd say the main fit difference was in the shoulders. the small petite fit me better in the shoulders (xs petite wasn't available). also the neckline of the small petite came up a little higher. the white is a slightly dingy off-white but i think the",3
A sweet tunic with the distinctive lace hemline. the length is great - just right to wear with skinny jeans or over leggings. not too long but long enough for comfort over leggings! more of a boxy fit (just as expected). wore it with my skinny jeans and short boots and got many compliments.,3
"I ordered these for store pick up and loved the color (red ones). the fit in petite ws nice and flattering, but iwould have to wear them with ehels still. th reason i didn't keep them is perhpas the pocket placement in front didn't flatter me as well? i think maybe i will order when on sale, or find a similar style with different frnt pockets.",3
"Nice work top! i ordered the slightly yellow ivory print, which is beautiful, and the print placement perfect. even better, it's work appropriate. the cotton/synthetic blend has stretch without stretching out.

size: i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands like meadow rue. i'm 5'4"", approx 140 lbs, 35-30-37, 34d, narrow shoulders, short arms, long torso.

fit: the sleeves are slightly long, but the buttoned cuffs rest at my wrist. the fabric blend allows this top very good drape. i like",4
"Wore this poncho and received 5 compliments before the school day even began! love the pockets and hood. bought three at the sale price - one for me, a friend, and my niece - different ages and sizes but everyone of us love this poncho.",4
"I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it's a bit big, though. opt to size down.",4
"You can't exactly tell from the picture, but this dress has a skirt that bubbles a little at the bottom, and it really adds interest to the whole piece. i think my favorite part about this dress, though, is the weightiness of the skirt--it's not so heavy that it's hot or uncomfortable, but enough that it feels more quality, more special.",3
"This top looks great with a long straight skirt (the grey with a black skirt....) and skinny jeans. i can understand why the style might not work for everyone but for me it's a perfect blend of elegant and funky. i'm sometimes a medium sometimes a large and the medium work well for me, so if in doubt size down",3
"As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.",4
"The dress didn't look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried. the dress fits beautifully. i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame. i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist, but corrected by pairing with an obi belt, which looks fantastic. the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely. the dress has a modified hi/low thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides, but",4
"This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight, not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted, 5'7"",125lbs and the small fit.",4
"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.",1
"I accidentally found this gem at my store today. i adore layering my style, and this is a perfect edition. it's light, but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and doesn't stick to other fabric. i wouldn't quite call it ""gauze"" since its heavier than your typical gauze. it's super long. i'm 5'8 and it definitely went to my knees. when worn buttoned up, it's clean and classic. when worn open, it's cool, bohemian and edgy...while still looking totally put together. i adore this. wish",4
Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.,1
Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.,0

"I'm so happy i purchased this cardigan!! every time i've worn it i've actually gotten compliments, from both women and men:) i was slightly undecided at first due to it's quite pricey, but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper, not just a quick trend!! i'm so happy i snagged it before it ran out!!\ i have quite muscular upper arms, and the medium fits me well. the sleeves do have some give in them, and even though i'm also broad across my shoul",4
"I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale, i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s, but with this one, the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom, and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still, with some awesome heels, this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!",3
"This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large, but that is part of the ""look"" of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist, but they didn't have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering, but i also think it will transition well with tights, boots, and a cardigan when temps start cooling off.",4
"This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!",1
"I really wanted to love these, i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well, they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return, so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.",1
"This shirt is super cute and stylish, but too wide for my liking.",3
"Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller, but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.
they are very soft and comfortable, but i wouldn't buy them again.",1
"I absolutely love this dress! it's a great summer dress that's flirty and fun. i feel this dress runs pretty true to size except in the bust area. the buttons at the top pull a little bit on me unless i wear a bra that pushes the girls up and together. i'm a 32ddd just so you have an idea. i'm 5'10, about 145-150 lbs and i'm a 4-6. in dresses i'm usually able to get away with a 4. i have a bigger bust and bum but a super, tiny waist. i'm just barely able to get away with wearing a 4 in this dres",4

Perfect spring transition piece-- saffron yellow but medium weight and breathable. this color is in for spring and the perfect blend for a not too warm cover up!,4
"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i",4
"This dress is beautiful. it may run a tad large. everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric, beautiful design and colors of the print. it will go straight into fall. so very happy i tried it! i have a beautiful, elegant dress for the hot weather.",4
Great sweater with gorgeous detail. fits tts. works best in someone with smaller bust like me. pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented. pairing it with gray ag jeans! will work great for fall/winter in louisiana.,4
"I honestly never even tried this on - i ordered it and when it arrived it was not the kelly green color pictured, it was more of a dark bland green color. love the brand and very soft but had to return.",3
"This dress is beautiful. i love the collar and tie neck detail. i decided to order up a size and am very glad i did (i normally wear a 0 or 2 petite and ordered this in a 4 petite). it fits perfect with a little room...not snug at all, which i like. the description says its a slimmer fit so i'm happy i ordered the size i did. i'm excited to wear it and add it to my wardrobe.",4
"I love this sweater. as others have mentioned, it's not the softest acrylic in the world, but i can overlook that for the simple fact that it's adorable. i like the cropped fit- pairs perfectly with high waisted jeans/skirts. the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap. the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion. i did expect it to be a bit heavier, but it's a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather. i may be biased because of",4
"This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper.",4
"This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter, though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose, but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.",4
"I love this vest-it is a work of art in its design and construction but extremely wearable, absolutely gorgeous on, and perfectly warm and functional. my favorite thing i've ever bought at retailer.",4
"I've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i've looked in a long time! fitted, but skimming where i don't want to be accentuated - it's a rare dress that can pull this off! the cleavage is there, so i think it's more of a night dress, but i'd wear it with a sweater during the day. very comfortable.",4
"I'm a new mom, and am thrilled at the structure and quality of this dress. it gives me a great shape, very flattering. i can wear it to work with a jacket or dress it up with jewelry for a fancier event.",4
"Cashmere is soft as a feather, yet warm, easy to wear and the pointelle stitches are lovely. i feel lovely wearing this and i'm really not that kind of ""lady"". so, if you imagine a side of yourself wanting to try out feeling lovely, bite the bullet and buy this cardigan. it does run small in my bust area, but all the rest fits well.",3
"I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot, especially the front macrame part, but for me it did not work at all. also, too expensive for a tee.",2
"I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger, it sort of looked like a tent on me, whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though, and it was folding down under the arms, making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center, as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we",0
"These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris.",3
The material feels nice and i love the flared arms.,3
"I second that above review who states ""worst blouse i've ever ordered""",0
"Absolutely love this dress. maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality. i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses. the dress is soft and flowing. the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you. i recommend trying on a dress by this maker . . . their cuts are consistent, so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online. this is a keeper and can be worn year round.",4
"Lovely holiday blouse, flows at the bottom but doesn't bell out like some tunic blouses. the arms aren't cut in to much and i found that flattering to my shoulders the velvet and trim is strong and solid while the bottom half has a sweet little polka dot finish. charming and romantic.",4
"I bought this top in the gray color and my usual size large.   the fit is perfect.  i don't have the tight neck issue that another reviewer had.  there is an odd knitted neck that you can't see on the model since her hair covers it.  i love the softness, fit, and embroidery of the top, but was debating on returning because of that weird, stiff neck knitting.  my husband said that he really liked it, so i gave it a shot.  i'm wearing it right now and it's super comfortable. i don't notice the nec",3
"I have looked at this dress a dozen times online and passed. after reading other reviews felt compelled to see why everyone is in love with this dress. when i opened the box i was blown away. this dress is so beautiful and the crystals, which look like sequence online are high quality, as is the fabric and craftsmanship.
a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!
you must have this dress in your closet!!!!!!!
ordered my usual size and fits perfect.",4
"Mes demosilles style incorporates lots of material. this cotton layered, voluminous dress is an eye catcher but not for all figures. i like this bohemian style because it is different and can be worn with a belt to show off more of your figure or loose fitting. 
i ordered a 36 size which fitted perfectly around the bust but i have broad shoulders and there is no zipper. i had to purchase the 38 size so i could remove the dress over my shoulders without too much trouble.",3
"Based on reviews, i was concerned that this dress would not fit in the chest area. however, i find that i have ample room there (i am a full c). it is a tiny bit tight in the waist, but not uncomfortable or unflattering. i will go ahead and say that it runs small for that reason. the straps are a little long on me and will need to be taken up. also there is no zipper so getting it on and off requires unbuttoning the buttons, so it's not fast. 

overall quality is very nice and it is very prett",3
"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack.",1
"Just not the right color for my skin tone (though lovely pink). i didn't see the green in person, but probably nice too.

the cut is well fitted at the waist, elastic band. i will say, however, that it was almost hard to pull the shoulders over (doesn't unbutton past waist). fabric is soft and flowey, length on the regular was mid-though for me, i am a tad oder, so it was nice... if i were younger, i would get petite.

for reference: 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 inch waist",3
"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small.",2
"Let me begin by saying i own quite few pilcro jeans, the script, and hyphen to name a few, absolutely love them, they fit tts, super soft with just the right amount of stretch. the em jean have the perfect retro look, super soft, with just enough relaxed fit to still look stylish. unfortunately, i noticed that they have gone up in price a bit since they were introduced as the signature jean for retailer, andddddd, they are no longer made in the usa, but in china....so you may need to try on",3
"I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b",3
Ordered these in a size 32 and they fit perfectly!,4
"This dress is lovely . i am 5' 1, athletic and busty (38 d/dd) - but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chest/arms. i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest. im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous. material/item is so lovely and comfortable!! i never have extra chest room, so this was such a great surprise!! hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small.",3
"I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on, and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger, but, in fact, it's a very surprising find, as others have mentioned.
_____________
pros:
- a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit.
- the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this.
- lots of stretch and very, very comfortable. i can see myself wearing",3
I just received this blouse and love it...more beautiful in person..i got the black one in a petite and it is perfect...if you want it longer in the front order a regular.,4
"Like most of the other reviewers, i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up 2 sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round, too.",4
"Too thin at bottom where lace is.  couldn't sit in the dress without worrying i was ""hanging out""",1
"I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!",3
This top is so cute.  i love it and get tons of compliments on it.,4
"I really wanted to like this but the fit was just off. it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too. this one was just too much material. i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me. i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in, but decided in the end to return because i just didn't love it. the pink color and the fabric are nice,  though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a 3.",1
"This dress is beautiful--lovely colors and design--but it's huuuge. i'm usually a s/m in tops and dresses, but i got an xs after trying it on in the store. i'm busty and have hips and still have a bit of room. the length is good--a little above the knee but still work appropriate. with my curves it's not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down, but i think it's too pretty not to keep.",3
Such a great top! the sage color is beautiful. love the simplicity of the top. slender sleeves and just enough flow to the top. this will be a great top to pair with a cute scarf!,3
"So different loose linen, i love the raw edge and the color i can wear with anything over a dress...great top with raw edges",4
"An retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace. i tried on a large for my 5'9"", 36c. hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size. my thoughts are....
_______________
pros:
- breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend.
- lace detailing at the top is lovely.
- runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small (and i have smaller circumference). but there's enough stretch.
_______________
cons:
- extremely sheer!",3
"The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. 

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.",4
"I picked this maxi up in navy to go with my summertime capsule wardrobe that i will be doing extensive travel with this summer. this dress is well made and fits my frame in a size m perfectly (5'4, 125lbs, 34c). it is substantial enough to disguise any backside indiscretions and the halter style front does not expose the girls. i do wear petals with this dress to ensure that i don't put on a show especially in air conditioned rooms. this launders easily and doesn't look rumpled and wilted after",4
I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.,0
"I love this dress and received many compliments when i wore it. the pink is beautiful. however, it does run large so i will need to exchange it. the little square at the base of the neckline was crooked on the one i received. might not bug anyone else, but it bothered me.",4
"This dress is just as it appears. it is very well made, lined and falls in heavier but fluid waves. the bodice fit snug and the zipper worked almost perfectly (!). the color is very pink, like pepto bismal but not in a bad way, if that's possible. my husband loved the dress on me but my 22 year old daughter thought it was too pink, too girly... i think i decided it was just too young for me- i'm 53. . alas, i am returning it but i still think fondly of this piece. i am 5'4"", 110 lbs and i bought",3
I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.,2
"I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!",3
"I own this tank in three different colors, and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up! they are soft, good quality, and wash up well. i've taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase, and also have used them as little camisole shirts. they don't fit too tight on, just right. i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in.",4
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully. i bought the blouse in black, but will also probably purchase it in the cream. the blouse is made very nicely, however i had to deal with about 6 embroidered pieces that were not knotted. i had to take a needle, and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery. some of the individual flowers just came out entirely. however, this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g",4
These pants are so fun! i use them to sleep in as they are see through. i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large.,4
Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.,4
"This blouse does run large especially in the length of the sleeves (but the rest of the shirt fit well) pretty pretty blouse. hides bulges, runs a little long. super soft material. a must have for fall!!!",4
"Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.
i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same. 
obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.",1
"I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did! i usually wear a 4-6 and the 6 fit great. it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events. i have a long torso and don't find it too short at all. it is a tad tight across the shoulders, so if you are broad in that area, it might not work for you. overall, love!",4
"This is a beautiful and classic blouse. great fit and flow. however, the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily; tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate.",4
"I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap, is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.",0
I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.,4
I love this poncho. it' so soft and cozy!! looks great with a pair of tights or jeans. just adorable.,3
This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it weren't sold out in my size. love it!,4
"A couple of months ago i bought the white in this top in my usual size small. it's cute & flowy & like to wear it with ankle or capri leggings. have worn with shorts as well. casual & cute! plus i love cotton anyways. 5'3"", 117#. think i'll go ahead with the other colors since the heat will be arriving soon....",4
"This was long on me (i'm 5'1"") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material, this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.",4
"I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.",3
"Order yourself a pair today! my new favorite jean, especially for spring/summer. good color and very comfortable.",4
"This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference, i am 5""4, 115 pounds, and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.",1
"I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it's even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes aren't too large which is always a nice plus:)",4
This dress is so cute and comfy! i purchased it for my friend's wedding brunch celebration - perfect transitional piece!,4
I was pleasantly surprised with this cardigan! i get so many compliments- i can easily see me carrying this into my fall wardrobe!,4
I love this top and it's so pretty in person.  knew it would be full but was hoping it wouldn't be too big.  it's perfect and looks good with jeans.,4
"This top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things. it was a bit short for me, as i have a long torso, but i wish it had fit right!",2
"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.",4
"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger",2
"This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions. two other people in my family own this dress and love it, it's now my turn to add it to my collection. the dress is quite long for my 5""6"" frame, so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length. the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing. very elegant, a little chanel like. and by the way, the belt is included, as another reviewer",4
"I love this blouse! it's very flattering- gives the illusion of an hourglass shape. the fabric feels soft and flowy, and the pattern is pretty; it does need a camisole underneath because it's kinda sheer. it does run small! i usually wear a size 0 in retailer clothes, but i bought a size 2 in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me.",4
Im a busty gal at a 34ddd and this was pretty flattering. it showed off my curves and hid my unfit belly with ease. i usually am a small to medium and i ordered large in both the grey and gold stripe and i love them both. they fit flawlessly. very flattering and i like the high neck line,3
"This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5'2"" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips.",4
"I am 5' and 3/4"" tall. too ""tall"" for most petite pants and too short for regular pants. these ran a little big. i weigh @140 lbs. and have been wearing mostly 28s and 29s, which is what i ordered. the 29s were a tad too big around the waist. the 28 fit but were so long that they looked like clown pants on me. i am in the conundrum that i can never find cropped pants that fit because i am in between petite and regular height sizing. these were a perfect example. they both went back. loved the qu",3
"First, this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured, however, it's long on my 5'2 frame. the price is also a little steep, but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom.",3
"I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms aren't tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c",4
"This dress is adorable. the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer. the cotton is also nice and light. however, the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips. if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you.",2
"I bought these stretchy skinny cords in my usual size 28 (31 waist, 33 low waist, 38.5 hip/butt).  they are comfortable and long enough for my 5' 9"" frame.  i hope they don't shrink.  the flower pattern on all the pairs in the store has the flowers running down the inside and outside of my legs.  the dark part runs down the middle.  i wish it was like the picture on the model, with the print running right down the front and backs of the legs, dark parts on inner and outer thigh.",3
"I just love this. well made, nice fabric and looks just great over pants or jeans. im very pleased with this quirky piece and got it on sale too!",4
This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!,4
"This suit is better than i expected. i'm a large d cup and with this type of top style, i typically size up. i'm a 4 bottom but would normally would order a large top because this type of top runs small...not here. i ordered the large and, much to my suprise, it's too big. i'm sending back. i may order a small and medium just to be safe, but the cups are definitely not cut too small here. the bodice is very flattering with the black and white contrast. so pretty!",4
"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up.",1
"I saw this online and wasnt sure and actually walked right past it in the store. but my usual stylist walked around the store with me and insisted it was a goodone. she usually knows what she is talking about... super soft nd comfortable, love the long sleeves (it has hidden buttons), cut is flattering on everyone. i ended up ordering petite size. turtleneck is not too tight, and the dress can pretty mjuch be dressed up or down. my friend also bought it (huhm twinsies)!! my favorite design was t",4
"Green- feminine and flattering, love this dress!!",4
Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.,4
"Material is nice, great for a party or date night. fits true to size, (l for me, i'm a 12). would recommend. the bell sleeve is right on trend and very tasteful.",3
The cut of this top is cute. it's a great basic t with a little flare. it's pretty pricey given that the fabric is so thin.,3
I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!,1
"I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.",0
"I was looking for a red and black plaid top with a twist, and this tee definitely fits the bill! i plan to wear this shirt with a long sleeve tee under it for extra warmth for casual holiday events, and can see it with a skirt and cardi for work. fabric is soft and comfortable. fit is loose but not too boxy.",3
"This is a super cute tank- fits good, flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer. fits good.",4
Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.,1
"This chemise is very pretty in person. when i tried it on, i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise. the material is kind of thin, but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it, it won't show. it looked super cute with a denim jacket on. i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly (for reference, i am 5'2"", 34b, 120lbs). i am very happy with this purchase, and i can't wear it as a chemise, a coverup, or a hot day sundress. highly recommended!",4
"I tried the regular szie in store, like the cut, need petite though (too long and a lot of fabric) - i am 5'1.5"" and 115lbs... color, unfortunatly, looke aweful on my skin tone and washed me out. would need to be more red, the striping washed out the color nad dind't look flattering on me. the cut did, however.

so, if you ahge a good hur to your skin, good dress for you, if you are palelike me, i don't recommend...

ps love hte tie waist. picture not asflattering as on person.",3
My favorite for work or going out. the perfect black shirt.,4
"I had my eye on this dress since it fist came out, but hesitated to order due to some of the lower reviews. when i got a chance to try it on - i loved it! i did go up a size. i am 5'5"" so i had it shortened to above the knee, i didn't mind losing the unfinished hem - had the hem match that of the pockets. i am a 34c but the bodice is stable and even if i pull at it, it stays put! so happy to find this, especially on sale! i plan to wear it at our company party which is help on a large charter bo",4
This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything. one downside is it wrinkles easily.,4
I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.,4
"I've been looking for some new, casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8"", not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however, i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it, however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this",2
"Adorable peasant fitting top.  not too voluminous, just right for over jeans, and really cute with shorts.  the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down, and the cut is classic!",4
"I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric, no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms, might work for you. sending it back.",2
"If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans, leggings, sandals, boots, and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!",4
Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.,4
"I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty! i had been looking for a dress/tunic like this for some time. i got the lovely soft grey/white combo and it is lovely on. normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect! also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece! easily dresses up or down, both jeans and leggings work well",4
"This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft, fully lined, and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges.

i got the size 's' according to the size guide on the mara hoffman site. i'm 5'2"" currently 33-25-37ish without a bra on (bra size 30d, 32c, even a 28dd if i can find it). the front coverage is perfect. it also fits around the back, but i",4
"I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.",1
"Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i",3
This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!,4
Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.,4
I love the loose vibe of this top. the bold stripes are super cute. i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers. get this top ladies!,4
"I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3"", +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics, so that may vary a bit. however, the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash, but sometimes that's worth it.",4
"I am on the fence about this dress, as you'll see the reasons below, but it is really breathable fabric and extremely comfortable!
_________
pros:
- tons of stretch to the top part. i'm a 36c, so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust. however, i fit into a medium here without it being too snug. you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight you'd like it to be on you.
- the bottom half, the skirt, feels so nice on the skin. very breezy. it is layered an",3
Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und,4
"Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans, pencil skirts and capris .",4
"I love this tunic! it's wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am, this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets",3
"I knew when i bought this bralette that there was something special about it...the intricacy of the design is really pretty as is the style...but seriously - every single time i wear this bralette out (paired with a cute top or dress) i get tons of compliments from all of my friends. i never thought a bralette would spark so much conversation! aside from that it is super durable...i've had it for a year now, have washed it several times, and it is not stretched out at all or frayed aka it is gre",4
"Love this dress! adorable, comfortable and figure flattering! cant go wrong with this purchase!",4
"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely, and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy, embroidered material, very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color, but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing, and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly, although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1"", 130 #, 3",4
These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans. they are expensive but so worth it. i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but won't rip further. i wear these at least once a week.,4
"I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.",4
"I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me, but it lays perfectly. very comfortable, well-designed, flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops, but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!",4
"I received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strange...to tight in the bust and the arms were to big for me..i am so bummed...the arms do not stay on my shoulders. i have many tops but maeve and they fit me well..this is the first one i have to return. this top is made well and i do recommend, but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you!",2
"Fits true to size! looks great just wish it was a tad longer but i am 5'10"" so...",3
I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.,3
"Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just",3
"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature",1
Love everything about it but had to get a size bigger to be long an off/ to short for a mom. if i was 20 would be fine.,3
"I bought this dress in store today in a size 4, i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress, there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.",3
"I ordered a petite small. i'm 5'3, 135 lbs and 34b and the length was perfect and the fit was great. like the previous reviews. love you can wear a bra with it.",4
"This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress, i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.",3
"I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik",4
"I ordered this dress in both colors. i'm very fair and blonde and the darker dress just swallowed me up - looked really messy on me. the lighter one.....love it. it's very flowy and not form fitting, of course, but something about the lighter color just seems less overwhelming.",3
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it,4
"These jeans are so adorable and so soft--i really wish they fit! unfortunately, even the next size up was too snug for me.",3
"I love the idea of ruffles, but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium, and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes, it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer, but it's pretty thick.",2
"This dress is modern yet timeless, cute yet rock and roll if worn with boots. i am 36b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size regular s fits well. i like regular size because it is longer in the torso (lengthens waist for a belt) and the length is right above the knees, appropriate for work. the bust area fits me perfectly so well-endowed ladies may want up a size. i am into grey now but all colors are gorgeous, love the sheen, colors are true like shown (1 star off for hi price for a simple dress).",3
"Picked this up yesterday in the muted teal. great shape, great color. the pink one is way brighter in person and the green, i think, is more of a forest green. each one was a little different. super cute. good price.",4
"Awesome light shrug. goes with so many out fits, over tees and dresses. tts. get one! orange color is a pretty neutral.",4
"Beautiful and classy- i love this! i'm 5'8""/125lbs/34b and my usual xs works great (could probably also have worn a s). i was a little worried it'd be scratchy and/or too structured, but it's soft and flattering. photos are accurate. would definitely recommend!",4
I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldn't resist and i'm so glad i got it !! it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many  different ways.  it really makes you look slim too ! i got the size small and i am 5'4 and 130 lbs and it's a perfect fit !!,4
"So a bit of a bone to pick with retailer. i am normally a petite xs (32b chest). however the petite sizing was not available online so i ordered a regular xs thinking i could always have it altered. i could barely button across the chest. huh?! when i went to return it at the store, i noticed they had xs petite on the rack so decided to try it. it fits perfect - like how it should! i can button fine across the chest and there is a little extra room.

i have no idea why the sizing is so off between",3

As soon as i saw this skirt i was in love. i like the fit it is very comfortable. i love the detail in the crocheted part of the skirt. i can't wait to wear it and i recommend this item.,4
"I ordered this coat in a size xs during the promo. it just arrived & is too big. sleeves way too long & big under the arms. it's labeled xs but looks more like a m. i don't mind an oversized fit & having the sleeves altered but this is just not working. if petite were available it may work for me. it is nicely made, soft, comfy, button front which i prefer instead of snaps. i think it wld be super cozy on a cold day. love the print! i am of small build, 5'3"", 115#, usually a xs-s, occas petite.",3
"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.",0
"I like the color and design. it looked super cute when i tried it on, but when i brought it home, i washed it in the washing mashine and hung it to dry and it shrank before i even got to wear it. be careful with washing it!",3
I'm about 10-15 lbs overweight and the material clings a bit. this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape.,4
I love these pants. they are really comfortable without sacrificing style. perfect for the office or just running around. i'm 5ft 9inches and 165 lbs. i bought the medium which fits perfectly.,4
"Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it's the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5"" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it.",4
"Perfect.
these cords are soo soft, but hold their shape
low rise is great for shorter people ! regular rise comes just between navel and bra !",4
"Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg, have plenty of length (i'm 5'6, and there is a good inch of extra length), but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though, but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey, probably a size 31 in jeans right now, and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality",4
"More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid",4

"This is my first romper and i am in love.  so comfortable and easily dressed up or down.  i am usually an xs, small, or petite small in retailer brands.  the xs worked best for me.  the petite small was too big.  i am 5'2"" and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length.  i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly.",4

"This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside, it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large, but since it's a flannel romper, not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!",4
"I simply love this jacket. it's comfortable, soft and has a relaxed fit that is easy to wear. i wish i had bought mine while it was on sale.",3
Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear. i can't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.,3
"This is such beautiful material, but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i'm wearing shoulder pads. that structured element compared to the rest of the dress (relatively unstructured) just looks ridiculous. i was so looking forward to this dress, and now it's going back.",2
"I love the patterns and the colors! easy to dress up or down.  i ordered a small and just ordered a can to compare them. the cut is great as the sides still meet even though there's no closure. it's a good weight for this weather and winter! i live in sweater coats where i am and this is a great addition.
it's a little itchy, that's the only flaw.",4
"Love, love, love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well. buy this dress - you won't regret it!",4

"I usually try to buy things on sale but after trying this dress on twice, i didn't want to run the risk of waiting and it selling out. it is extremely flattering and i think it will be very versatile - i'll definitely wear this dress to work, out with friends, and you could also wear it to bridal/baby shower events as well. i bought the dress in blue and it is extremely comfortable. i do think it runs large - i am 5'9, 145lbs with a very straight (no hips) / athletic build (have an athlete butt)",4

"This is a beautiful sweatshirt. that is a sentence i've never said before! mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up, which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something. it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom, so i am hoping that they will ""draw up"" a little once i wash it. kind of bummed about that: for almost $100, they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit. the sweatshirt is a little more square-fitting than it looks in t",3

"This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!",1
"I bought my first pair of ag stevie jeans at retailer six years ago and have been in love with them ever since. still love the style and fit but have never been able to find another pair made of the same jean material. my first pair are just a wear away from having holes and was hoping this new pair would be the perfect replacement but although great, just not the same.",3
"I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store, i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole, but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home, it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design, cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.",2

Love this shirt. it is long enough in back to wear with leggings. it is very cute and casual on. not fitted at all. i am 5'2 and ordered a regular size so that it fits longer.,4

 i didn't want the knit dress to be too tight or else it would stretch out after sitting. i like the colors and the fabric. the weave is loose and after snagging it on my glasses taking it off i'm careful with it. it will be nice into fall with a sweater.",4
I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!,4

Love the color. love the design. at the hem this top runs wide. i'm still deciding whether to keep this as i think the wide hem may be somewhat flattering on me.,3
My normal size m fit well but i wouldn't want it to shrink any. hangs well.,4
This top is perfect. i absolutely love this sweater. it is super cute to wear with shirts for the summer and it will look just as cute with jeans for the fall/winter. the color is very subtle and not too pink. it is super soft and i would 100% recommend this to someone!,4
"This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact, it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size, not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute ""lounge at the lake"" ensemble.",4

This dress runs a bit small in my opinion. for reference i'm a 36/38 c and usually a 10. the medium is tight at the bust. the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me. the sleeve and overall length are too short and i'm going to return it.,4

i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.",4
"This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size, i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.",4
"I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer. i was so delighted after trying them on because i've never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked. they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests. i wore them for several hours at a party and they didn't stretch that much on me. i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric. i'm 5'3"" so t",4
"This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!",4
"I bought this top during the extra 30% off sale, so the price was definitely worth it and i know i'll get a lot of wear out it. i bought the grey and the lace isn't too revealing, but just enough for me to want to wear a cami underneath, especially at work. i'm normally a small/4 in retailer brands, but i bought a xs and it fits great, so it does run a little large.",3
"I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.

the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &",4
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.,0
"I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and",0
"Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late, this brand has really fallen all over the board for me, but this top had the right fabric, fit, and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute!",3
"Love this top!! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it. i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame, but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out. also, this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles!",3
It's a very pretty top. a little tight in front at the bust. i'm giving it 3 stars because the fabric is very flimsy and looks cheap.,2
"Love the colors for fall, feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!",4
"I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2"", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs",4
"Love! the detailing is so pretty! and finally!!! it's a top that's comfortably long. retailer has been making all of their tops so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and a dd. i ordered a large simply because it's a cotton tee and i didn't want a fitted look, per se. my only criticism would be that the material is a little thin in the front. i just ordered it in black too!",4
"I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.",4
"I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!",4
"Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size.
thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.",4
I like this top very much. i love the color and the embroidery makes it very dressy. it fits right for me however the picture doesn't show it well but there's a bit too much fabric on the sides.,3
Just got the small peach in the mail; love it. also got the black small petite; works great as this shirt is pretty long. great boho tee.,4
Pretty pink top is great for layering iand alone in the summer and spring,3
"Like the other reviewers have said, this is a wider shirt, but the width done is in a stylish way. i did not think it looked frumpy or sack-like on. however, i found it to be rather short. i bought a 0 regular (not petite), and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer, madewell, etc. which have the same looser fit. i am 5'2, 115 lbs., so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on me...if you are tall, it might bare your midriff some. i bought the peach, which was close to the color pictu",3
"These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for, but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!",4
Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!,4
"I love the color and the style, however it doesn't look as well as the model as i don't have a small waist like the model does. still overall, i love this dress and it is well made and comfortable",3
"Very soft, cute design, great over leggings!",3
Great tank! i really like the black and white striped one! very versatile .,4
"Comfort is very important to me. as someone who is not a skinny girl, slimming clothing is important to me. this top is very pretty, comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. it does require dry cleaning, which might be a con for some people.",4
"I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great, so soft & comfy, but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me, it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top, but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model, this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty.",2
"Love this top! love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable. love the print which makes it stand out. love the design of a side bow. i did not have an issue with the banded hem, in fact i like how it makes the top more structured.",4
"This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey, but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft, flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels, just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.

i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.

thank you!!!!",4
"Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4"" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it.",2
The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.,2
"This sweater is so soft, beautiful and well made. it runs just a bit large, but i love the look.",4
"This dress had my attention immediately online, but in person it was even prettier. i would not say the colors are very ""pink"" as the color selection indicates, rather browns (with possible pink undertones) and yellows, and even a splash of dark green in the print here and there. there isn't a ton of give or stretch to the fabric so a larger chest may need to size up. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size 4 fit just right (though i don't have a ton of extra room in the chest",4
I just received this dress tried it on. i totally fell in love with it . the pink is just beautiful.it's a little big so i will definitely will be exchanging it for a size 14 . you would absolutely love this dress.,4
"This top is so comfortable and better quality than i expected. ruffles fall nicely over your sholulder and there is a fabric underarm, i don't have to wear a tank top underneath like i normally would with tops with wide opening around arms. color is beautiful too, i really love it. true to size.",4
"While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!",4
The tshirt is comfy and has a little curve on the tail which is fun!,4
"When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.",1
"I purchased the blue and it's a wonderful deep blueish purple. i like the chiffon detail which makes it a bit more stylish than a normal tee. fits nicely, a bit big but not enough to go down a size. the material is not sheer and a nice light weight.",3
I love this tee so much i bought in every color available. i have received so many compliments on each one! so soft and comfortable and easy care.,4
I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors,4
"This is the perfect dress to take traveling. dress it up with heels or down with sandals. warm up and wear it with a short black sweater. a nice easy elegant dress. size small fit nicely, medium probably would have been fine too.",4
I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back,0
"Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days, while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.",4
"I really love the colors of this top, especially in the pinky pastels. it fits really well, can be tied or untied, and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts. speaking of that, i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer ""am i hiding a pregnancy"" feel to it. 

but...the price tag. $98 for a tank blouse is just too much for me. i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope it's still available once it goes on sa",4
"I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale.",0
"Love! i always used to wear skinny jeans until i discovered these!!! highly recommend. they elongate your legs and curve in just the right places. super flattering! plus, they are extremely comfortable. however, i'm 5 ft 2 inches and i have to wear a good 2 inch heel with them!",4
"These pilcro jeans are so very cute. i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans, but i didn't want to chance them not being available in my size. the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast. the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy. you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg. they do run a bit big. i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit. i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy.",4
"Recently bought these on sale, though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4, the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model, but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas, and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy, as sometimes happens with this style.",4
"This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. 

the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim.",2
"I have had this dress for a few months now and find it is super comfortable for the hot weather and can go dressy or casual with the right accessories. it does run large in xxs; the xxs petite fit a little better by was way too short for me. even better is that you can wash on the super gentle cycle and lay flat to dry. yes it says dry clean only, but its is made of cupro and you should be able to wash that material. i have washed mine several times and it has never shrunk or lost shape. the she",4
I'm very happy with this sweater--it's very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear. i have the pink version and find the shimmer on the waist and arms to be a nice touch. the only concern i have for this is that it feels like it stretches out a bit easily. by the end of the day the arms feel a bit baggy.,3
"Overall, i thought this was a very pretty blouse. i loved the colors and the design. the construction seemed good. others mentioned that it ran large, but i am tall and often struggle with the shoulders and arms, so i purchase my normal size small. i believe it is the width in my shoulders that caused the blouse to hang funny - you could see a decent amount of the back fabric hanging around the front sides, which looked odd. it made the front fabric look like it was cut at an angle. (i am not br",3
"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said, they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up, not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts, and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women.",4
"I love this top and despite the higher price point, it came home with me. normally i tend to go for very basic colors - white, black, gray. but i saw this and was intrigued by the high neck and subtle cut away sleeveless style. tried it on and it was love. the fit is great. it is flowey, but without the maternity look in front and all that extra fabric in the back. it's just right. i love the print and i am so not a print person. i tried it on with some taupe skinny jeans and a denim jacket. per",3
"Love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job.  i think it does run a little big.  the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium, but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well.",3
"This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else, but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress, this will be a hard dress to wear.
the color is really lovely though!",2
Fantastic price right now and very flattering!! cute and sexy dress that hugs but its forgiving!,4
"I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5'4"" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn't notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside",3
"Great feeling trench. can dress it up or down.
just be prepared to take a steamer with you. it comes wrinkled and will wrinkle very easy.",3
"I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.",1
The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.,2
"I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great.",2
"Really cute top, the material is soft and feels like great quality. love the loose cut and slight detail to the simple shirt.",4
"Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!",1
I love this shirt! i received many compliments on it when i wore it to work with a skirt.,4
"I love this, just bought it and so glad i did. really want to wear it out, so hopefully the weather will cool down soon since i am in the south and we are experiencing an extremely warm winter. regardless, it will be with me a long time...so if i don't use it this season, i will eventually as it is timeless and goes with anything.",4
"Love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look. quality seems ok, though i'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it's the perfect length at the moment (i'm 5'7"" and it just covers my butt). good sale purchase!",3
I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....,4
Love it - material is soft and color goes will with any color.,4
"The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.",4
I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!,4
As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.,0
I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.,4
"There is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip. instead it has an elastic waist. it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist. i am 5'6"" and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste.",2
The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well,2
Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth,2
"This wrap is awesome. soft material, perfect length sleeves with thumb holes (!), and warm, great for layering.",4
Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.,0
I really love this sweater. beautiful color and nice texture. i can't wait to wear it.,4
I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!,4
These give an amazing slimming effect and i love the dark wash and fit on the waist. only negative is that being 5'4 and a size 30 the length of the pants is a few inches too long for me. i still love them but will have to wear heels with them always.,3
"The color of this dress is sublime. so is the fit. ruching in all the right places. made me feel glamorous. it's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat, vest, or cropped jacket. the material feels so nice against the skin too. it's a must have.",4
"Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues, gold, neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.",2
"Love the look of this and the fabric, but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0, then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.",1
"Wow. this is the perfect sweater. beautiful, soft color. lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons. it drapes beautifully. the knit is tight, no see through or snags. very soft and comfy. the casual, easy, pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style. am starting to love this designer. highly recommend.",4
I love this dress. the quality of the material is very nice - good weight and softness. the dress hides my baby belly and feels really comfortable on. i got tons of compliments when i wore it!,4
"These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering.
really, i knew the minute i saw them, i would love them. but, i do have to say that the lovely model
wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu",4
"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. 
people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.",4
"I love the color, the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality, the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act",3
"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!",4
"This cardigan is light weight and can be used for all seasons. additionally, you can wear it tied in the front or down for a cascade look. can be worn for the office or with jeans. love this little good for everything closet staple!",4
"Dress it up or go casual - this dress has it all. well made and comfortable where other ""lace"" rubs the wrong way under arms - this is super soft. cant wait to pair different shoe colors and jewelry.",4
"The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust, i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.",3
"Would recommend, but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over, even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5"" 120lbs narrow hips, usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned, plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow, the material is really nice, soft and comfy, color was good (i ordered the dark), and i could imagine they would be super cute",2
"So this top is adorable light and airy and i like the loose fit, i think it will nice and cool for summer. the red is very flattering color, i have fairer skin and feel like it gave nice color without being overbearing. love this top. my only complaint is that i feel like the the arm hole is a bit snug. not enough to not keep, just wish there was a little more room.",3
This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.,4
"I ordered the purple in size xl. the fit on me matches the model so i think it's true to size. i wouldn't say there's much purple to this print. i can't really find any. the areas where the blue/red overlap just look navy. the photos show how it really looks. it's a great mix of light brown, peach, white, red and different shades of blue. there will be variations because of pattern placement. i love this style--it's very comfortable.",4
"Fun take on the white shirt- it is flattering and fun. and yes- very soft material so comfy!
but as others have stated, the material is very thin so your full bra outline will show- or you throw on a cami.",3
"This is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath, and will be fun in the summer too. i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out, and it was still really cute. great cut and design. as others have mentioned, the quality could be slightly better, but it's a good deal if you get it on sale.",3
"The fabric is very soft, love the purple floral color. the top is very flattering with the ease and comfort of a t-shirt.",4
"I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.",3
The length on these are great. they stretch but so far they don't stretch out. the material is a dark and soft. i am 5'6' and 135lbs. the size 26 fit great.,4
"I like the idea of a skort, and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i can't wait for warmer weather to wear it!",3
"I ordered this on-line. i love the sleeves and the pleat in the back, but the top runs large. i ordered a small, but it is too big. other reviews say that the top shrinks when you wash it. however, i'm not sure if the store would let me return a washed item if it doesn't shrink enough for my taste. i think i will probably be returning this top.",3
Art on a dress- belt on the back makes it interesting,3
This is the first maxi i purchased this summer. i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i didn't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom. it is a beautiful flowy dress. no need for a slip. it has beads on the bodice. i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up wouldn't have made that much of a difference..kinda uncomfortable in the chest area. has yet to be worn so may return..,3
"Love this top!!
great colors and fits great
reasonably priced",4
My local store offered this dress in a navy colorway with sky blue and pink embroidery. tried it on and fell in love! it fits well while being comfortable. my favorite part is the skirt - perfect flirty a-line. already bought matching cardigans and can't wait to wear this to work. so perfect for spring!,4
"I wanted to give this top some love. i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them. this top is definitely the winner. the neckline, sleeves, pattern, fabric, and length are gorgeous and flattering. it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatile....it could be very dressy (depending on what you wear it with) but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals. it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath. i orde",4
"I bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces. the top is amazing! it is soft, great fabric, a cute cut, and can be styled in so many ways! definitely worth the buy!",4
"Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull.",4
Love this dress!  i sized up from a 6 to an 8 because of the small bust issue and it fits perfect.  perfect casual summer dress with a vintage feel.,3
"I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic, but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8, to give you an idea. i would recommend it, but it is going back for me.",2
"Such a cute and comfy dress to wear. colors are vibrant just as they appear in the picture. the m fit was better for me than the small. ( 5'7', 140lbs for reference.) it's such a great dress to throw on and go. love it!",4
"I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return, etc. 
i love this so much!",4
"Retailer, take me away! this dress transports me to an island. i ordered a small and exchanged for an xs, i could have probably even done an xxs (thank you vanity sizing). i'm not tiny. i'm 5'4'' and 130lbs with lots of baby left overs. 
i love the details of the dress and so many people stopped me to compliment it. and, while a few people thought i was pregnant while wearing this dress (because women obviously only wear flowy dresses when they're pregnant), i welcomed the seat offers with wide o",3
"Totally love this shirt as a basic with fun details. super soft great quality fabric, and the cutouts add the perfect bit of interest. can see this accessorizing well and looking good with jeans or skirts. really happy with it. fits loose, but tts.",4
I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.,4
"I ordered a regular size 6 because the petite size 6 was sold out. it was too large for me; maybe the 4 would have worked. in part because the size was off, it looked frumpy on me with the poofs and flowers. however, i did like that it is cotton and has its own beige-colored slip that snaps on at the shoulders. i have no doubt this could look very nice on someone if the size was just right.. i like the black crochet-type details.",3
"I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!",4
"Wonderful and comfortable dress, very sweet.",4
"I never buy prints.....but this was so understated and elegant i could not resist!
just received and it is lovely!
beautiful soft hues with the softest of pattern that will look fantastic with jeans.
the buttons are beautiful and a special touch!
will be wearing this top often........pretty, soft fabric, comfortable fit and a ""goes with everything and everywhere piece!""
a must get!
i wear a medium and ordered my usual size and it fits beautifully.
love!
reminds me of a monet watercolor..",4
"I've had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog. my daughter's name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love - simple. when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price. it is so soft and comfortable, yet flattering. it's a must have. now i want to get this in black!",4
"Very figure flattering!! i am 5'6"" 128 lbs 32b chest and size xs is perfect",4
"This sweater has the weirdest stitching, although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)",1
"This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.

this one is going back.",1
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.,4
"I normally wear a 4 or 6 at retailer and bought this in a 6. the size 6 is even a tad small in the bust area but not small enough to size to an 8. i am 32d for reference. for ladies larger than a c cup, i would recommend sizing to your larger size. definitely try on at the store if you can.",3
"I am 5,7"" 135 lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape . it was just big and frumpy . it went back .",1
I bought this dress in a medium petite. i'm 5'2 and 140#. it fit great and made my waist look really tiny. i cannot wait the dress with heels or else you would see the entire shoe. it works perfect with flat sandals. i've received tons of compliments! you can also wear a normal bra with the dress. love it!,4
Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!,4
"I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee, so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy, but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't",1
This shirt is such a pretty color i was so excited to get it... however i felt like the fit was not flattering. it sort of just hung on me. didn't do much for me. i actually ended up returning it.,2
Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i'm 5'7 and 135lbs.,3
"I have an hourglass shape and a large chest, so it's difficult to find dresses that don't like i'm wearing a sack or are too form-fitting to be appropriate. this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist, while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events! the color is perfect",4
"This dress is just right for weddings and all-
it fits nicely-the skirt makes it fun and it feels so comfortable-it
is just a perfect solution for fun evening dress-
i always carry a camera to weddings and this will be so great to
wear while i am taking photos.
it looks current but easy to move around in-",4
"I'm 5'4'', between sizes 12 and 14. i ordered a size petite large, and it's a bit loose, which is acceptable, but i'd like to try a regular size medium to see if it'd be more fitted like i see in the model.
my problem is with the length. i read the description and it says petite = 40.5'' of length. the large petite i ordered is above my knees, this is not 40'' of length by any means, it's 36.5''.
i'd really appreciate if the size info was correctly available.",3
"I needed an outfit for my son's christening 10 weeks after he was born. one thing i have to keep in mind with purchasing items now is how well they work for easy breastfeeding. this jumpsuit was perfect 'dressed up' with a cropped tuxedo jacket, cute shoes and jewelry. i felt so chic and not only did it fit my new post-baby shape, but was awesome for nursing him when needed. i felt comfortable all day and look forward to 'dressing it down' for less formal occasions. the material is so soft and i",4
"Such a beautiful print. i sized up to a 14 because it looked like it has a high waist and it does. the waist comes almost to my bra line. unfortunately, there's a huge amount of fabric and it swallowed me. not slimming at all. i felt like i was wearing a curtain.  i loved the slits in the photo but due to the amount of fabric they weren't visible. i'm short and this literally pooled on the ground a few inches. if you're tall and thin, this is a beauty.",3
"Love the pattern and material (not thick) for spring and summer.  like the fit and style. i'm 5'2"", 115#. i've purchased regular (not petite) front and side zip (with internal button) charlie trousers earlier this year and last year.  got a size 4 (i vary between size 2 and 4) in the front zip trousers and they stretched out and got a little loose after fitting perfectly.  so i got the side zip in size 2.  those were tighter initially and stretched out but are still snug.  with this particular p",4
"Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress, fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.",2
"I purchased this dress in ""yellow"" in a size 8 and 10 since i'm between sizes, and the 8 fits like a dream. i love this dress. it's a nice length, hitting just below my knees, and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great. i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it. i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person, but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing. highly recommend!",4
I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.,4
"For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier, more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.",2
"I like these jeans because they are long enough to wear with any kind of shoe or boot and they have enough stretch to be comfy, but not too tight and they do not bag out :)",3
"The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below:
___________
pros:
- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.
- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.
- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.
- front ""v slit"" isn't too low or reve",3
I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.,4
"I just got this shirt the other day, and already love it. it fits like a basic tee, but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute. the shape is loose at the bottom, which makes this really comfortable.
my only complaint is it's a little tight across the back, but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top. this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too, so the quality feels nice.",3
"I loved this top, but had to return because the stiff applique made me look like a linebacker! i wish it could have worked out, because this is a cool top. if this particular design works for you, go for it!",3
"I love this tunic! it runs slightly large. i ordered my usual size small (i am 5'4'' 125lbs) and it is a looser fit but falls nicely. i wear it as a dress, and the blue/gray color is so pretty!",3
"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4"", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.",2
This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.,3
"Very flattering, not too short, beautiful. i'm 5.6, 36d, usually wear m in dresses, wide hips. the 8 fit very nicely.",4
"Warm and cozy tights for my daughter, she loves them!",4
"Cute and different dress, cute with boots.very comfortable, runs large, could size down",4
"This poncho is my new favorite thing. the material is soft and it is long enough in the back to cover your butt which i also love so that i can wear leggings underneath. i normally wear a size m top, but bought the xs/s poncho otherwise it was just too big. the only negative is that you have to hand wash :(",3
"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks",4
"I was so excited to wear this shirt, even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot, and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders.",1
"As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality, well fitting leggings that do not slide down, shift around, or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want, nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep",4
"I love it. perfect, body hugging, just right length and great fabric colors. this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve. it is, however, unforgiving-there is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges; it is sleek and so figure-flattering. i am 140 lbs, 5'5 tall and 34d and it fits perfectly. one more pound and it wouldn't have zipped! i got a size 6 (my usual)!but too tight had to size up to 8. if you are on the fence, go up a size. i can't, however, imagine wearing this sleeveless a",4
"Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price!  all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all.  i'm so glad i gave this a try.  my body is large on top with a square waist, a bit of a tummy, no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate.  not sure why this is called halter though.  i am 5'3"" 36dd, wide torso, size 28 jeans, 140#.",4
Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it.,2
Can be dressed up or down. details are pretty without being gaudy. i got an 00p which fits well - i can wear it with a belt to give it some shape too. love it!,4
"It is the perfect top to wear in the summer, it is nice and you can be somewhat dressy or super casual. i don't like anything too tight around my stomach and this has a nice flow with just the right amount of material.",3
I can't say enough about this jumpsuit. within 1 hour of wearing this shopping i had 4 compliments from strangers.   it is flattering. pretty. soft. comfortable. love love love,4
"Got this top in white and the rust color. other reviewers mentioned it being much too large, so i went with the xs instead of my usual small. it's slightly oversized, but i love that look, and it's still flattering on me. i also didn't find there to be too much fabric. i am very tall and am happy with the length of this. 34b, 126 lbs, 5'10""",4

"I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it's been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i'm not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear, but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn't do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn't suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don't expec",1
I am not a big fan of lace but this shirt has just enough. it actually looks better than the photo and it looks even better when you wear it. i have received numerous compliments on this shirt everytime i've worn it.,3
"This shirt is semi-fitted. i like it because it is not boxy but not overly tight. it is not heavy even though it is a sweatshirt material. i wish the neck was a bit higher but i will wear a tee under it. the back is really cute. 
it is different and i like that.",3
The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.,2
"A cute dress. i did not have the issue with the slip being too tight. i wish it had a little more shape to it. while flowy, it looks a tiny bit tent-like. i still like it and wear it into fall with booties and boots!",3
"Wore it this weekend and the compliments were overflowing! it's exceptionally flattering for busty women (i'm a 32dd). i had to size down from an 8 to a 6, but even the 8 looked good, just a bit loose in the bodice. v neck is just right, not too low, not too high. print is gorgeous in person - colors are much richer than the online photo. the flowy skirt is very slimming and forgiving for hourglass and pear shaped body types. but if you have slim hips, you might feel like you're swimming in fabr",4
"This blouse is not only flattering, but a great way to dress up a pair of jeans! fits well, but a big tight around the arms, had to go up a size.",3
"I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however, the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it, so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!",2
"This is adorable! the sweater is light-weight and soft. please know that the sweater line falls right at my mid-riff, followed by the fringe, so for me, it's almost cropped. the fringe covers my mid-riff. the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter, but it is stylish and cute. i love it! it's different and unique. i purchased xxs in petite. fits a little more cropped than the photo shows.",4
"This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton, but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to",4
I love this top! it is long enough for my torso and arms. i am thinking of ordering in another color.,4
"I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut, but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.",0
"I purchased this top in the navy. the picture makes the top look like an interesting blue with some purple in it, but in person the top is just... navy. the lace and fabric are soft. it fits true to size; i almost always wear a small and the small fit fine. it wasn't quite my style, but it's a pretty top that will be great for spring and summer.",3
"These jeans are so great, i'm thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out, despite the price. they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell. the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy - these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans. love them!",4
I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.,4
"I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small, i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b, there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5"" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees.",3
"What s lovely surprise this jacket/cape/poncho is!  first, it is a substantial piece.  heavier than it appears.  it has an almost faux suede feel to it, with a deliciously lush french terry lining.  it looks and feels very rich.  i bought both colors and was glad i did!  i live on the coast and this will be fantastic over a sweater for morning walks along the shore.  i'm a l/xl and the m/l size is a perfect fit!",4

"This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.",4
"I bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful. fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in it!

the colors are vibrant and the unique texture really lends itself toward a clothing item that is special- even for retailer.

recommend it highly!",4
"This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2"". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.",0
"I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design, but when i received it, it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.",1
This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s. it runs pretty large so i kept size xs. the material can be stretched. but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin. i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go!!!,4

What a sweet shirt!! the ski pattern is adorable and they have a cute cat pattern that i've only seen so far in the store. the fit is small. i sized up from my normal 8 to a 10 but could have even gone to a 12 as there wasn't much difference between the 10 and the 12 except in length.,4
"I ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big. i'm 5'7""/ 34c /132 lbs and usually a size s in this brand. this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge. i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large, it did wash up well though, no pilling.",4
"I wish i could wear this sweater every day! it is extremely soft. runs large. 5'9"", 130lbs, bought a large and it was way too big, but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer. sleeves are too bulky. it's not perfection, especially the sleeves. the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up. there is no way you could do that. they are almost like bell sleeves, and the material stretches like crazy. wish i had ordered down, but still love it.",4
"I saw a photographer wearing this at a wedding i went to in october. i absolutely fell in love. it is beautiful. i can't wait to wear it for the holidays! i got the small petite and i am 5'2"", 125 lbs. fit great. enjoy!",4
"This dress looks better when wearing, i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect. length and width. in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length. the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length.  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily. i wish the slip is the same length as the dress. i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric. i hope it helps.",4

"I didn't give this dress a second look for the longest time. when the summer tag sale came about, i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress. i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down. the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first, though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous. this dress is amazing on! i am an hourglass shape, 5'8, size 6/8, 34 d chest, and i tried on both the small and medium. the small fit much better on me, and i r",4
"Adorable fall dress. but it runs huge -- i'm an hourglass 8 or 10 usually and the 6 fit best in the top and full skirt (36d, 30 waist) but sadly each size the sleeves get like 2 inches shorter. since these are blouses sleeves they look off. so sad bc this dress is adorable otherwise. if you always find sleeves too long for you, snap up this gem, this is for you!",3
Really cute fun print. nice summer dress..,4
"I got these in the mail today and to me, they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though",1
"I bought this in a medium regular for someone else. i usually take a petite xs and it seems to fit me! i'm surprised as the pullover version seems almost like it runs a bit big. that said, this is a beautiful cardi! it's soft, the colors of the flower are vibrant, it's flattering once you adjust for the size issue. it will go with a lot of things as you can dress it up for work, or dress it down a bit with jeans.",3
I got the blue & it is so cute! i'm a very consistent 2-4 & i ordered a size 6 & that fit well. the a-line does stick out farther than it shows in the photos so i'm having that taken in some...looked like a triangle. it's definitely worth the price & super flattering!,3
Love this top - it's flattering and perfect for a casual dinner out or running around on a saturday afternoon. super comfortable and very cute.,4
"This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online!! i'm a curvy gal so i honestly wasn't feeling like this would look good on me. but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it...like it would be rainproof! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion, even cuter than the blue side! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj",4
"Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!",2

"I did buy these when they were 40% off the sale price. well worth it. they are comfortable, thick but not too warm. they are my 'nice' home pants to wear outside. =) i love them. i got a large and they fit on the baggy side but not bad. i'm usually a large or xl.",4
"This is a great staple piece for your closet. i do agree that it runs large. i am usually a small and ordered this in an xsmall and that was perfect for the billowy-ness of the top. i have a long torso and arms, so going with an xsmall made the arms slightly short on me. i do not see this as an issue as i just pull them up to 3/4 length on my arm (the sleeves are elastic so this is possible). i receive compliments every time i wear this top. it is beautiful and comfortable. i definitely recommen",3
"I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online, but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup, i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight, the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even",2

"Having recently purchased a pair of citizen jeans from retailer in my normal size, i went ahead and ordered these because i needed a skinnier fit (my stevies finally ripped). they fit sort of big in the seat, but improved upon washing and are a bit more snug. i took them to the tailors and had the length taken up (i always have to do this, but these were particularly long). they are not as skinny as on the model, but will still working for going to work. not really what i was looking for (an every",3
"This green dress seemed more fitted and tailored on the model. i ordered a small and medium in the green and mint (even though it says mint, it's a grayish blue). usually i'm a medium but even the small seems a bit big. it fits more like a loose boho dress rather than how the model wears it. the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is nice. i will be keeping both colors in small and just have to accept that the fit is similar to a looser casual summer dress. if you look at the pics that other c",3
"Great jeans by pilcro, too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.",2
I love this shirt. it is so soft. not boxy at all. very flattering. my only complaint is that there aren't more colors!,4
"Cute shorts with great fabric (and lined so they lay smooth over your body). i really love that the material has a dressier feel, but they ran a bit large and looked sort of frumpy on me (curvy body, 5'7'', 150). i'm returning them and trying a small. elastic waist is great for me after having a baby, but would look just fine under a belt or covered by a shirt.",3

soft and cozy and the ruffles are not overwhelming.....just a touch of pretty!
it will look pretty with a turquoise necklace for a pop of color!
classic, comfy and classy!

runs very true to size, ordered my usual size an it fits perfectly.",4
"Got this in the red, like previous reviewer mentioned - it does fit snug.
you might need to size up if you are busty and want a much looser fit.

other than that, super comfortable and soft fabric",3
"This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9, a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!",4
Great with a tank top underneath and jeans. i also wore with a delicate gold necklace. charming!,4
"This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe! the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great. i got the pink, which surprised me because i wear so much black. the length fits longer than most rompers, which is great. it makes it a classic fit. i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up- the waist has elastic, but it's snug.",4
"For once, the dress looks better on me than on the model. mine is tight above the bow and black/grey. my bow isn't this big?not pulled so much and maybe it's not knotted in the photo. it's heavy canvas and doesn't show my flaws. i'm saving it for summer?can't imagine wearing it as a jumper as in the photo.

for me (5'3"", 32e, 125 lbs) the bust is slightly tight in a 6 but the shoulders are a bit wide in an 8, but both look good. mine is not petite and hits me above the knee (6).

the dress is co",4
"I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good, though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu. 

i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia",4
"This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website), but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand), and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase, absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.",2
Super soft and the trimming on the neckline and sides adds character to the shirt. runs a bit shorter than i expected.,3
"I tried these on as i needed bottoms to try on some tops (and i was wearing a dress), but ended up liking them. the fit is snug but comfortable, they didn't ride up and the denim is supple. color is nice too, looked really nice with a swing tank that i half tucked. i have muscular thighs, so shorts are not an easy thing for me... anyway, recommend (tried on 25: 115 lbs, 26-27 inch waist)",3
"I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel, but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!",4
I wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didn't fit to me unfortunately... but the design was pretty!,2
"Spotted this in the local store last week & just had to try it on! it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way. my usual size small was too big. the oversized look was fine from front & back view, but in the side view the bottom stuck way out. the xs was much better so i took it home. its very comfy & looks great with dark blue denim. 5'3"", 118#.",4
"This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.

i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package, there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that, but i usually don't find belts in my size.

as for the fit, it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!",3
"Looks nearly exactly like the picture. will be very comfortable to wear. i ordered a petite large and could really have worn a medium. it's big all over. i figure i'll do a little tailoring on this come spring and adjust the fit. on the whole, happy.",3
Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.,4

"This is a nice looking skirt. the corduroy has a little sheen to it. looks cute with a sweater, tights and boots. length is slightly longer on me than the model in the photo. there are small slits at the side seams and the hem is curved at the slits.",4
"This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.",4
Love! accurate sizing feminine details my new favorite top,3
"This cute blouse runs a little bit small, particularly for large busted ladies. i found the silk fabric to be less luxurious and more utilitarian. it's still a beautiful blouse. due to sizing issues, mine is going back.",3
Wish i would have bought them in every color. love,4
"Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state, it is short and wide. i like the top so much, i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(",1
"I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.",2
"I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9"". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha",2
"The back of this dress is stunning. i am usually a petite but could get away with regular. tried on xs (115 lbs, 30dd chest) and it was good length and not too low cut. colors are really fun, the mango one has a tiny bit of sparkle in one of the lines. flory and airy.",4
"These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great!",4

This is a beautiful skirt. it is exactly as pictured. the colors are bright and vibrant and the skirt is very full as expected. i feel like it does run a bit small. i'm usually an 8 in skirts and dresses and bought a 10. it was a bit snug at the waist but not too tight so i decided to keep it for now. my one complaint is the horrible noise that the skirt makes with my every movement. anyone and everyone can hear you coming from a mile away. the skirt is beautiful but a little stiff as well. i do,3
"Picked this up in the white, and it's adorable. i'm a 2 in maeve blouses, usually just to fit my bust. i picked it up in the 2 because that's all my store had, and it fits. it's definitely tight across the bust, but not constricting. the shirt has no give, but it's still comfy, and to be expected from 100% cotton. the peplum is very dramatic high-low, and poofs out in the back also a little dramatically but gosh that's what makes it so gorgeous! great blouse, so precious.",4
"So bummed... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house, so i tried it on. while i agree with the other reviews, it runs big in some areas, something about the neckline just wasn't right on me. it seemed to ride up higher and wasn't what i wanted. also, the ""raspberry"" color is almost more of a burnt orange. when i think of raspberry, i think of pink or red, this was neither of those. the top itself is cute though and super comfy. if it we",2
"I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short, even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad, because the shirt is cute.",2
I love this skirt so much. it's so comfortable and flattering. the button design along the sides is adorable. it's got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that it's not see-through in anyway. it's a great buy.,4
"I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe, but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately, i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long, so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't",2
They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.,4
Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.,2
"Pretty color, but i was hoping for a thicker, higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.",1
"I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge, i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.",2
"Couldn't resist this jacket! it's perfect for business casual dress code, for staying warm in air-conditioned offices and goes with many colors and styles.

many times jackets are too tight on my shoulders or not long enough for my arms and this fits perfectly. (i'm 5' 7"" and i bought a medium)",4
"Not only was it love at first sight when i saw it online, but i fell even more in love at first touch! everything about this dress is perfection. i got the black motif & the colors are just lovely. the weight & feel of the dress are nice, & the length is great. i added a skinny black belt for more waist definition, but it's cute with or without it. i am more than pleased with this purchase.",4
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.,4
"I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy), but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee, but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said, i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.",2
"$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money, but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side, but very flattering. plus, the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front, but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b",4
This top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length. nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute. size down!,3
"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!",1
"I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua, but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo, but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it), but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size, but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).",2
"Though i am a true size medium, i do not like fitted tees, so generally i buy a large. based upon other reviews, i decided to give the medium a try, hoping that it would be loose enough. though i am on the cusp of petite (5' 3 1/2""), i decided to go with the regular medium since i prefer longer, tunic length tops. the medium does run big, imo, and fits me like a large would. it is loose, flowy and long enough to cover my entire backside. the sleeves are long and i do have to roll them up, perhap",3
"I was very excited to get this piece, but it wasn't quite right for me. very well constructed and nice material, but the open sides were a bit too open toward the front. the top zipper was tough to do on your own.",3

very versatile...can wear with jeans or dress up with all black.",4

"This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms, so i think for everyone else, your normal jacket size should be perfect.",4
"This dress had beautiful details, and the material was better than i expected; however, it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack.",1
"Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.",0
There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.,2

I usually wear a 27 in pilcro and for these i have to size down to a 26. the 27 was very large in the waist. they are a great dark denim color and look cute with the bottoms rolled up a little.,4
"Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and",4
"Grabbed this off the sales rack-not expecting much-but it is a great sweater! like other reviewers mentioned-roomy but still form fitting. i wear it to work with black pants and boots and it looks great. cozy, warm, very cute. i usually wear a small but got an xs in this. a much better sweater than how it appears in the online pics.",4

"I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!",4
"The photos do not do this skirt justice! i'm so glad i picked it up in the store, as i would not have given it a second look online. it is soft, stretchy, forgiving, and one of the most versatile pieces in my closet! i dressed it up for an evening event and can't wait to throw it on with a tee and jean jacket! love it!",4
"I happened to really like this top. it does show some back, but looked cute with high waisted jeans. i happened to like the raw hemline and found it quite comfortable and cute. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the size small fit well, though i could have gone with a medium for a much looser look.",3
"I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. 

the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i",0
The waistband is reminiscent of yoga pants except looser. i think these pants are a little large and wide-legged. i have a bigger butt and i like my pants on the looser side overall so maybe that is why they were super loose on me. i think they are a great way to get away with wearing casual pants when you need to dress up. i feel like they would look best on a taller person. i need to get them hemmed.,3
"Nice sweater. i love the detail in the front. i didn't like that it was lined... it seemed too much like a jacket instead of a sweater to me. nice details on the sleeve but the sleeves are a bit long. i have found many retailer cardigans to be a bit on the small side so i sized up with this sweater.

no need to do that. this sweater is true to size.

i am usually a large and i felt the xl was too big. it fit like a jacket instead of a sweater. the sleeves are too long for my liking (i like 3/4 sle",3
"Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.",0

really lovely. glad i bought one before it was sold out.",4

"I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months. it's so soft and cozy, i'm tempted to keep it! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist (belly button) and i've got a shorter torso and am 5'4.5"". i got this during the 40% sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price. a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night, more of a cab to curb piece.",4
"I would not have tried this on or ordered it by myself, but my stylist brought it over for me to try (as it was on promotion). well, ok, i get it, i actually liked it on, but the regular size was too big in the arm hole... thinking of it, i should have ordered the xxs... maybe i will.

flattering style, comfrotable fabric, really nice overall...",4
"I love these with tunics and little dresses! they hit at a funny place on my hips, though; i wish they were a bit higher-up. since the waistband is thick, they show through tops unless they are pulls up above my hips, and they're a bit too short-waisted for that. but i was able to stretch them a bit, and i love them!",3
This skirt is so cozy and comfortable. it is form fitting but has a lot of give/stretch. the material feels high quality and heavy without being overly hot. i am sure this will be a go to skirt.,4
"I love these jeans, but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.",2
"Love this dress.fabric is very soft and flattering. i paired it with wine suede boots. great material, i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories. i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine. great go to dress!",4
"This blouse is lovely. i ordered a large because so many blouses run small for me, but am returning for a medium, as it fits pretty loose. i love the tie. its unique and feminine.",4
I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.,2

Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints,4
"I tried it on while out of town. i was concerned about getting it home but i kept thinking about it. i purchased it online once i got home. the colors are beautiful. it's a swing dress with quite a bit of ""swing"". this is perfect for me because i'm sensitive about my mid section. i wore mine with 3.5in brown sandals. my husband said i had ""legs for days"". i'll take that as a great compliment. i usually wear a medium but could have worn the small in this dress. i preferred the medium because it w",4

I agree with the other reviews! perfect color and weight to the dress. should wear well in summer and fall. i'm 5'5'' 34c 140lbs athletic and got the 6 regular. fit well and the length was perfect with flats.,4

"This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut, and that the buttons are covered. however, the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly, i don't think i can recommend this shirt, though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body, but it still looks great. i hope this helps!",2
"I've never owned a romper, and never had any desire to. but the classy design in black, soft, flowy fabric reeled me in, prompting me to push my boundaries a bit. i'm so glad i did. i don't think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun, and certainly not at the same time. i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan, and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids. i love it!!

"If i could wear this top every single day, i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf, skinny jeans & ankle boots, or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however, i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.",4
"Oh boy...i didn't get this one, and it runs small. too bad.",1
"There were no reviews, it's an ""online exclusive"" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth",0
I really love this brand and i love the fit of this blazer. my bottons were loose on this jacket and i got the rose color too and i do agree with the other reviewer that the color is more terra-cotta. great for spring and cool summer night. it runs tts im a 36dd and the medium fit nice.,3
This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.,4
"The material is nice and has a lot of stretch. i ordered the small as i'm a 6 in most dresses. it fits comfortably  i could probably get away with xs but have a large chest so was afraid it wouldn't cover me. i'm 5'2"" so a petite might be a bit better but it was sold out. i'll have to wear tall wedges with this one.",3
"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms
this is a wonderfully soft and warm sweater. the pink color is heathered with some grey and goes with just about any neutral bottom. the neckline was a little fiddly when i first tried it on, however like one of the previous reviewers i folded the left side under a bit to make an asymmetrical cowl neck, and it lays very nicely and looks great. runs a little big, i tried the medium and it fits perfectly. another great sweater from moth!",4
"Great summer pants. real wide leg. fit perfect even my muscular thighs. run a little roomy right of the rack but stretch out terribly. in my regular size, they start falling off after few hours of wear. long. dragging on the floor on my 5'7 frame.",4
"First pair of mother jeans, went with my regular 25 (as in my citizens/paige/ag) and it fits well. the waist doenst seem as high as it looks in the model (i wish it was). the fabric is stretchy and soft. it looks the same finish/color as online, a greyish denim. i like it.",3
"Cute top, a little less fitted than i was expecting.",3
"This top is very flattering on my torso (my ""problem area""). the sleeves are adorable and i love the navy with purple tints and the touches of gray. i would say this product could work on most body types. it's very comfortable and i could wear it for a long time. i would suggest considering a smaller size than one's normal size, but i would look into both sizes and see which one you prefer. i ended up getting my regular size because i just liked the way it looked better.",3
I bought this shirt in the black cat print. the material is very soft and it has a nice drape. i wear a size 32dd and worried that the size zero may be too small across the bust but it fits perfectly. i am 5 feet tall with a petite frame. the front of the shirt falls a few inches below my waistline and the back of the shirt is longer and provides plenty of coverage so it can be worn with skinny jeans. i can also wear this to work with a pair of slacks and it looks nice. i would actually love to,4
"Love this top. comfy, soft, and a great length. slightly longer in the back, and works great with leggings or jeans. i love that is has long sleeves. i wish it came in more colors.",4
"I think this dress is cute! it caught my eye in the store and i got a bunch of compliments when i tried it on. i like the sunny yellow. i plan on wearing it to an outdoor wedding on the amalfi coast of italy in the spring. i am petite - 5'-2"", 105lbs and purchased a size 2. i think it may run a little tight in the chest, so perhaps consider sizing up if you have average or larger breasts. i love the pockets! the fabric seems to wrinkle easily, so hopefully i won't be too rumpled after having it",3
I had been looking for this dress in xs. the small ran large on me and xs had sold out online. i'd been searching for it calling every store around and not having any luck.. when allison called me from store 428 highland village in houston.. she had found the dress for me in the woodlands.. i was able to purchase it and i can't wait to get it.. it will be perfect for the hot summer here in texas. thank you allison for such great customer service and retailer for employing such great staff.,4
"This is a beautiful top, the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama. i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background. i'm not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides- not sure what that detail adds to the piece. it is a boxy shape, so be aware it's not going to hug the figure. the cotton is soft and medium weight. overall, it's a stand-out!",4
"Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso, larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however, the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small, which it does on top, but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work, but didn't.",1
"Gorgeous blouse, but a touch too large. i may return and try a small.",4
"Beautiful piece, very well made and drapes well!!! i love it!!!! runs a little big, i'd go a size smaller.",4
"Perfect summer dress: feminine, cool, with just the right flow. hides the bad, and has a nice shape.",4
"This shirt is perfect. hangs nicely, and i love the little longer sleeves.

beautiful color too!",4
"I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color, the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color, the design is off so have to return.",1
Loved the design and legnth but the material was not a light and soft as i expected.  i would get this in another fabric.,3
"This top is adorable and looked pretty on, but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it didn't settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped, but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off, even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped, so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot, but i didn't",3
These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!,4
"Got the black but the orange it very pretty too the black fabric has a sheen to it; almost like snakeskin. as other reviewers have mentioned, it does run small and the armholes are cut in a bit. overall it is a more interesting than a basic lbd.",3
"Such a great shirt! loved the fit and how it feels! i paired it with grey jeans!
loved it so much i ordered it in another color for myself and ordered one for a friend!!!",4
"Purchased this sweater in an xs, grey pattern (for reference, 5'4"", small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey, but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!",4
"This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34",4
This poncho is so comfortable. fabric soft and not too hot. this goes with so many things. my favorite purchase this fall!,4
I ordered the floral blue dress. i am a size 8-10 and ordered the medium. it did not find that it was large on top as others had mention. i love the smoking but would also look great with a belt and boots. it makes a great all weather dress.,4
"I bought this in the neutral motif, and it's exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life. the colors are ivory with dusty pink and blue/gray puffs of color. the fabric is incredibly soft. i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and i'm glad i did. if you like things really fitted, i guess you could order your normal size, but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath, i went with the medium. this zip-hoodie is great quality and it look",4
"I debated getting this dress for over a month and finally purchased it on retailer member day for 20%off. i wore it on a chiller night with a denim jacket and booties for a more casual feel. constant compliments from friends and strangers. 

only complaint about the dress is the slit. it does not go as high like on the model, stops right at the knee.the cross over is not too revealing (which is nice). overall the fit is great! im 5&#39;6 and usually size 12 and 36dd, the large was perfect!",4
"I bought this dress during the retailer weekend and i'm so happy i did!  this is a very well-made, well-designed dress that is quite figure flattering.  the marriage of artsy and colorful on a neutral background makes sense and the combination of colors and the style of the dress work well together.  the wearer will definitely have several options for footwear pairings.  this dress is as fun and playful as it is classy.  i can't wait for an occasion to wear this dress!",4
"Gorgeous, color, fabric, and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it's a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11"", the length is fine. if you're tall, it might be pretty short for you.",4
I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.,4
"I was looking for a tee that i could wear on the weekends without looking sloppy and also have a little coverage for when i'm feeling a little bloated. (come on, that's what happens sometimes on weekends, ha!) this tee is great because it's got some coverage and it's also not sloppy looking or oversized while still being flowy and flattering. 

the shoulders and arms are fairly tts and there's a slight a-line shape to this tee, so its flattering without being a tent or frumpy looking. i did si",3
"Was looking more for a tailored, blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p, ordered the 00, and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5'4'', 110 lbs, 32c for reference.",2
"Eva franco has done it again by creating another fabulously flattering, unique, and compliment grabbing skirt. it runs true to size and is very easy to move in and wear. this is my 10th skirt of hers and i love them all.",4
"Bought the gray online just to try it and i've already worn it 3 times! very soft, love the flowiness, and the scoop in the back gives it a slightly less casual touch without losing comfort. the only concern i have is that it may pill up a little and not sure how it will hold up in the wash. i'm 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size small was perfect (true to size).",4
These are my favorite pants. i love the fit and they are comfortable. i have them in several colors. i hope you never discontinue them!,4
"Love this dress! bodice and lace at bottom gives is a cute layered look. there are buttons on the front (see pic), but it does not button up. i'm a bit on the ""hippy"" side....physically hippy, that is...and this dress did a great job of downplaying my hips. ;) i'm 5'4"" and this dress hit just above my knees (a bit longer than on the model in the photo). would look cute with a jean or military jacket! i am wearing a small. 5'4"", 130lbs, 32b chest.",4
"Excellent tunic tee. will be great with leggings or jeans, which is just what i was hoping.",3
"It's soft and not itchy at all (itchy sweater is my all time nightmare). the design makes you feel like a snow princess. i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",4
"I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store, and brought home a size med. it's a nice weight of material, lined, and very classy. i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suit-jackets for business meetings. but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet, i realized how much it looked like a lab-coat. i am not giving up-- if it goes on sale, i'll order a small, to see if it is more flattering. but at this point, it's a no-go.",4
"I love this dress (i bought the navy with white stripes). it is comfortable, flattering, and versatile. best of all, i received a complement from my husband, who never comments on my clothing! the drapey knit fabric fits closely (but not tightly) in the shoulders and bust and then skims over the lower body. the fabric is soft and stretchy, not too thick, but still substantial enough that i did not need to wear support garments underneath (i am 5'4"", 123 lbs). i wore this to a christmas party and",4
"As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.",1
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.,0
"When i first tried on this romper, i grabbed a 6 (my normal size) but because of my bust size, i could not even get the top half to cover me at all. i decided to give this romper another go a month later, and tried on the 8...it made all the difference! i love it, it fits amazing, and it is just too cool.",4
I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear,4
"I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust, and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem, medium it is.",2
"I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer, but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.",1
"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",0
"Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch, lightweight, and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray.",4
"I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice, the length of the sleeves, adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering, adn i am glad the daker color is at the top, hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking. (regular hit just above the knee)",4
"This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it, and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide. 

even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant, the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12, this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants, in sweater form. ridiculous!",1
This is a unique beautiful dress and it fits like a glove.,4
"This is such a fun pullover sweater! i'm not much for sweaters, so i thought this would be a neat alternative. im between a small and medium, so i went with the small due to the swing style. it fit wonderfully! i'm even happy with the length which completely covers my behind (i'm 5'6""). i choose the gray and it's a great neutral, but now i'm contemplating going back for the red as well! hopefully a promo will come along soon!",4
"I absolutely loved the look of this top and had to try it on, so i ordered it in xs and s because i own a few other tylho shirts and know they can run large. when they arrived, i could tell with just one look how huge this top runs. i didn't even bother opening the s. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 135lb, 32c, and the xs is slightly too big through my bust. it's barely snug underneath my arms and not at all fitted down the sides of my ribcage, but i'm okay with that since it allows more room to wea",3
"I usually wear 26 or 27 in pants, but i sized up to a 28p for these. the waist is a little big but better fit overall. i ended up buying them in the white also.",3
I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.,4
"This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large, and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is ""roomy,"" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous, but a thin camisol",3

"I love this shirt! great fabric, nice quality, flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy, and the white is actually oatmeal.",4
"I ordered the white ""denim"" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering, but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!",1
The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.,2
"Bought this dress for my daughter (teenager) and it is perfect. it is a cute dress, perfect for summer parties, special occasions. it seems to run a little small and  wrinkle easily, but over all, she and i both are happy with the dress.",3
"This sweater dress was incredibly soft, and i loved the button detail down the back. unfortunately, i'm an hourglass figure (32dd with 26'' waist). this sweater did nothing to flatter me. i tried it in 2 different sizes; the ps looked far too big on, but the pxs created an awkward baggy area in my midsection while fitting nicely elsewhere. the petite length was great - i am 5'1 and i would not have wanted it any shorter. wish this was a little more tapered in the waist, because the quality is lo",2
"I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!",4
"This vest is beautiful and exactly as shown in the model shot. it is soft, warm, and drapes beautifully...perfect length on my 5'7"" frame. the leather detail along the edge is a nice high-quality touch. i will say that it is pretty itchy especially around the neck, but wearing a shirt with a collar like it is shown seems to help that issue. the dark color is navy in the print (not black)...overall i think this is gorgeous, but the full price feels a little ludicrous...i think i may wait until sa",3

"This 'poor boy' mock t-neck/high crew neck top looks a tiny bit more olive to me than the online photos. the fit runs on the smaller size, and the sleeves will be bracelet length or 3/4 length for taller women.

i tried a size xs that was in the store and it fit with the sleeves just above my wrists, but a size s would have been fine too (i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, narrow shoulders and torso).for reference, even the size m of the short sleeve version fit fine, so there is a lot of give.

"This t is a beautiful color, and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy, however - very thin cotton fabric, without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips,so instead of covering them, it highlights them. i'm disappointed, and am returning it.",2
"I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium, boy is it huge, the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable, even the small would be giant! 
for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge, it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.
the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one",1

"I adore this dress, but i never would have bought it if i didn't wear it with a belt. as some reviewers have said, it's a sack. the belt takes care of this. it still isn't a slimming dress, but i really don't mind--the elegance and comfort make up for it.

I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,4

"Love the texture and color of this tunic. it does seem to run large - i could have probably sized down to a pl without an issue. i do agree with other reviewers that the pockets are strangely placed and add bulk. i'm going to have them removed. overall, i really like it and have already worn it multiple times.",3
"I am somewhere between a size 6 or 8, so i ordered this dress in a size small. mistake. too small. the color of this dress is so lovely. it's between red and orange. will probably order it in medium.",3
"I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore",4
"I love this top, the beading and detail is wonderful, i actually liked it even more when i saw it in person. but when i tried it on it is really small in the neck and arm openings and seems short, definitely a different fit than how it appears on the model. i'm trading in for a size up and hoping that does the trick!",3
A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment. the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy.,4
I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.,1
"Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!",4
"Awful color, horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed",1
"Yes, $48 may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt, but this is one is worth it -- i can wear this with *everything*! i bought this in grey, and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night, or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day. one of the best retailer purchases i've made in a while!",4
"I love this dress! picked one up in store at 20% off--even better. i'm 6', 160lbs and 40-29-41, and i did find the waist runs a bit wide. because i'm tall, i think the length was a plus, but a shorter person would definitely want to go with a petite. i usually wear an 8-10 but bought a 6 in this dress, so i think it runs a tad large. the fabric is weighty enough to hide minor lumps and bumps, but i'll be wearing shapewear anyway. the pattern is perfectly aligned (just like the online images) and",4
"First, let me say i really like these pants before i get into what's wrong with them. the fabric is a nice weight and drapes really pretty. they are very long for you leggy girls out there or ladies who like to wear platform shoes and that's a plus for me.

now for the issues: the waist runs small, but not so much that i can't wear them. they are roomy and comfy otherwise, just snug there. the hem came out of mine, so that's the big bummer here. i have to hem them, which is a chore and i wish th",3
"This skirt fits me like a glove, you must get the matching top and orange jacket that makes the whole outfit high
fashion fun chic. i am 5' 8"" and 145 full figured and imlove this out fit. very cozy too.",4
"Love this! only wish it wasn't so seasonal so i could wear it more often. this is the softest shirt in my wardrobe. can't believe how nice it feels on. a little bit slouchy and over-sized. i usually wear a m and bought a m and it feels perfect. like the other reviewer, i was a bit worried about shrinkage but washed it in cold and hung it up and and it cam out fine. did wash first before i wore because the dye smelled a bit strong.",4
"I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful, the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35"" long, and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy, but it was really, really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider.",1
"I tried these on in the store, and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5"" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)",2
"I like the way the skirt of the dress swings when you move. in order to get the arm holes to not be too low, i ended up with the smaller of the two sizes i usually buy. i also appreciate the dress has pockets and the soft fabric. the tag says you can machine wash cold gentle which is also a plus!",3
This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).,4
"Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on, but can be worn in a versatile way, and if you are small chested, without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material, i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!",2
The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.,1
"I feel like this brand is very good at coming up with dresses that are flattering and i feel like they tend to fit my body well. i like the design of the dress a lot because it makes me feel like i am walking along with beach-it gets me in the mood for summer, and it is the perfect casual everyday dress for the summer. i love that the color scheme is understated which reinforces that this could be warn anywhere-even for everyday use. the strips are perfect for the look of this dress, and i don't",4
"I purchased this top online, love the off the shoulder trend and this looked like it would be perfect for fall. nice fabric and lace detail but the top definitely runs big! i ordered an xl and it was beyond swimming on me. definitely order a size or two down! also, it is very long / tunic length. i love a tunic but it almost wore more as a dress than a top! overall, cute item and fabric but definitely order down!!",3
Seen it online so i ordered it is so cute great fit patchwork is so pretty very vintage looking runs large would be cute with some skinny jeans and some booties,4
This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.,0
"I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.",4
"Fyi to help with sizing i am 5'7"" weigh 134 lb and like things loose fitting but the medium was too big and sack like. dress is cute and the color is true to photo.",2
"The design is gorgeous, the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however, it's extremely see thru.",1
"The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it, however, i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.",0
"This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10"" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?",1
"This top is everything i wanted it to be. the fabric is beautiful, and the fit is flowy and comfortable. i would love to own a u-neckline version.",4
"I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket, but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room, order a size up. the quality is nice, i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me, just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.",3
"Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei silky pull on pants. i got hooked on them last summer and was thrilled to see them for the upcoming spring. they run true to size. they are beyond comfortable and wear well. everyone should have at least one pair of these comfy pants in their closet. dress them up, down or wear them to the office. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.",4
"I like this top. yes it is very cropped and fitted but that's the style as shown on the model in the picture. but its true this style may not fits everyone. it probably flatters those of athletic or petite figure more than a full figure. i am 5' 6"" 110#. my usual size is xs. the top looks small to me at first so i tried both size xs and s. i took the xs cause i like it look fitted than loose. i wear this top with high waist fitted skirts or pants and it looks great. if this top can be an inch lo",3
"When i read car coat, i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin, long blazer. also, the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe, so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected, so it will be a return.",1
"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!",4
"Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long, stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...",0
I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint,4
The colour is gorgeous but it's basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though.,3
"Wore this & got many compliments. true to size, elegant.",4
"I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...",1
As beautiful as in the picture. couldn't go wrong with it. excellent quality and gorgeous color.,4
"I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton, and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur",1
Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!,4
"This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!",4
"With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:
_________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi",4
"Absolutely love! as others have mentioned, it's super comfy and the colors in the bottom definitely brighten up the sweater. the online brand says monogram, but the tag says sleeping on snow....weird.",4
"This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim, and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me, and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on, i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings, shorts, and sandals. such an easy, classic, simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.",4
"Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange, so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!",2
"I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress",4
"This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation, but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that, like many byron lars sheath dresses, the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t",4
"Incredibly flattering and going to be useful for multiple occasions - i needed a 'default' black dress and this is it.

only downside - it's pictured with a beautiful grosgrain ribbon at the waist, but does not actually come with the ribbon. i'll be trying to find something similar at a ribbon/embroidery shop, as the dress would really benefit from a slightly cinched waist.",4
I ordered my usual size small in this top (34c) and it just fits across the chest. very cute top.,3
"If you've been searching for red crops, gotta give these a try!! i bought my normal size 6 and they fit perfectly! they're a little more snug on me in the butt and thigh than on the model, but they're super flattering and the color is wonderful!! fabric is a tad thin, really stretchy (in a good way), and the weight is great for summer. i haven't worn them yet, so i'm not sure if they'll keep they're shape. fingers crossed!",4
"Just love this sweater, have it in both colors. can be dressed up or more casual!",4
Living a casual life style in key largo fl. i love a fitted t-shirt instead of a boxy shape. i'm 67 years and am very active and fit. love your store. classy,3
I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!,4
"This sweater/coat is great. it super comfortable. it's perfect for my california winters! it could be layered for colder areas. this piece definitely runs large- like really large. i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium. it is meant to be boxy, and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering. i'd definitely say go in store and try it on, you'll love it!",4
"This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.",4
"I literally bought this dress 2 days ago and now it is listed as ""no longer available"" on the retailer site. i am a size 12 with about a 36b-c bust. the thing i love about this dress is that it looks really nice without a bra. i was really surprised at how well constructed it was.",4
I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest,2
"A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure, this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.
i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta, but definitely needed a large.
i ordered the ""lavender"" color, which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead.",2
This is perfect if you are looking for comfort and style in the same bathing suit.,4
"This runs huge, not large, huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10, 150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered, but now its just too much of a hassle",2
This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.,2
"I ordered this online and love it. the fabric feels nice and it if fitted on the top then the bottom flows. i ordered a 4 which is my normal dress size and it fit perfect. comes a little above my knees. i'm 5'6"".",4
"The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night. i love that the cuff isn't sewn, so you can choose to roll them down too. with just the right amount of stretch, they are extremely flattering. they are definitely my new favorite pair this season!",4
"This wool jacket actually feels more as a cardigan, its a little too thin for a jacket but looks about the same as pictured. its very pretty. i ordered a l and it was true to size. sleeves are cropped. the wool material is surprisingly soft and comfortable. very nice and colorful addition to my closet. recommend! :)",4
I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.,2
Love the way this top fits. got many compliments on it! wish the arm holes were a little closer fit - can see the bra peeking out a teensy bit.,3
"Love the fabric, so soft and comfortable. it gives a very flattering silhouette. love those pants.",4
"Purchased in the light grey and was so excited, i wore it the very next day. the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy (in a good way) so it hangs beautifully. easily can be dressed up or down. new favorite tee!",4
"These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day. 

i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent",0
"I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me, this dress fit terribly. however, the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3"" and about 117 with a really short torso, and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller, or maybe with a longer torso, i could see this dress being really lovely.",2
"I often have a hard time finding items that fit true to size, but this top fits perfectly. it is cut really well and very flattering.",4
"Great fit, a little stiff. i typically wear a 4, and was able to take a 2 in this skirt, though a 4 would probably have been fine! it's just a fun skirt, with a little shimmer to dress up an outfit.",3
I really like this brand. i bought the t-shirt in the gray and the red color. the sizing is different for the colors. i kept the gray in a small and had to get a medium in the red color. they wash very nicely.,3
"I bought this awesome jumpsuit and i love it ! i really don't like wearing one piece clothing but this one its just so comfy and it looks great, i wear it with the straps or strapless and it looks different, as you can wear it classy or casual. and the best park, it has side pockets ! the color is as the description, navy blue and ivory/cream pattern. i wear a size 2. and that's what i got when i bought this, so pretty much to size for my  liking.",4
Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.,4
"I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something, they do not hang or move well on the body. also, they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly, these are going back.",0
This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.,1
"This is such a cute top with so much potential, soft fabric, vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top, regrettably, has to go back.
i love swing tops but retailer, could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??",2
"Yes! i love the color, the fabric and the fit up top. the skirt, however, is very poofy. i am going to let it hang for awhile (it was an online order) and see if some of that relaxes. otherwise, i will need to return it.",3
"I love this dress. it is exactly my style, which is probably why i love it: girly, frilly, flowy... i love how much material it has. it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric. it's the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming - i'm 5'5"" and it hits just above my knees. i am currently 6 months pregnant, and it's plenty roomy to fit now, and will also mask the post-baby belly this summer. the only 2 cons, and the other reviewers touched on these as",4
"When i saw this on a model at my retailer store, i fell for it. i love the colors and the weave of this kimono. it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular. it will be useful for cooler days and nights or air-conditionied places. the knit cuffs hold it in place. i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it.",4
"This tunic has really cute detail. it is hard to see in online photos, but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery. the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked, but it's still a keeper because of the two patterns, embroidery and beading. also, it is long and does run large, but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate. it is a tunic after all! i ordered an xs petite, and it will be very cute with leggings and boots.",4
"I ordered both the black & the dark grey, the dark grey arrived first! they are very comfortable & flattering! there is a nice thigh slimming effect. i purchased the size small, regular length & they hit me at my ankle (5,5"", 130lbs), i can't wait for the second pair to arrive!",4
"I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you.",1
"Bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist.",4
"This is much cuter in person than in the picture. in person, i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out. i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now, spring, and even summer! it is just a tad tight in my size 10, so i went up to a 12. thank you retailer - this will be timeless!!",4
"I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7"" size 10-12 and the large fit just right.",4
I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,0
"I love this dress, although the darting is terrible. the colors are much richer in person, it's a beautiful dress for events and has a nice weight so it doesn't feel too flimsy (since it is not lined). i really love the length of the sleeves and the swish of the skirt. however, the darting makes your bust have two little triangles- i really wish i could reseam the darting as it's a bit strange looking.",3
"This is a great dress for me to wear to work, lounging on a sunday and everywhere in-between. i'd even wear it over a bathing suite on a chilly beach. highly recommend it!",4
I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.,4
This product fit well and was soft and beautifully made.,4
"I loved this romper so much! the material is thin, but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy, like on the model, to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.",1
"I was fortunate to order the perfect size the first time. i am 5'3"" and 125 and ordered the size 4. it is a great fit. these lightweight pants are super cute and i especially love the way they are cut to dip a bit lower (not asymmetrical, just talking about the drape) on the inside hem so outside hem is perky and the bottom looks wide and is flattering. these zip up the back and the back lays flat which is also flattering. i love the look of the fabric so if i have a complaint it's that for the",4
I love this dress. even more beautiful in person ??,4
"Pretty obsessed with this top. it feels like a cotton, poncho. it's definitely made to be over-sized and flowy. it even hangs off the shoulder some. it does run very large. i'm normally a medium to a large and i purchased the xs (never ever an xs normally). even still it's loose as it's designed to be. so definitely size down 2 sizes. other than that super comfy and a casual top that can be worn to make my leggings and flip flops a little more ""fancy"". would also be nice with jeans for a casual",4
I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.,4
Loved the flared style of this cardigan. i first choose the yellow and returned it for the navy. the knit pointelle design is interesting and the cardi is so soft. have used it many times already - always makes me feel great.,4
"Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5"", 135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is, i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2"" longer would also be a slightly better length.",2
"I was eyeing this one for a while. based on the style and other reviews, i did order one size up. i think it would have been too small [catch on the hips] in my regular size. i do wish it was a little longer, too. the back is fine because it's longer. it's definitely wearable though. i wouldn't recommend it for a work function if you're a bit taller. despite all of that, i really do like dress. it's a new favorite. i ordered the blue --- love the dot pattern. i wore it with brown booties and it",3
I am not a one-piece body type. this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on!! i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the 1)perfect length of shorts 2) drapey fabric (not clingy) 3) asymmetrical cut of the top. highly recommend!,4
"I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress. the fit is great and is made with great material. i am 5' 7"", 110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress. the length falls right at my knee. it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit. a very cure feature. the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice.",4
"As you can tell from the pictures, it's nothing fancy; i think this dress will get a lot of wear for everyday living. simple and comfy. reviewers said it ran pretty small so i sized up but wished i hadn't. it is not very ""fit",3
"Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky, although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!

but it's a keeper",3
"I was in the store looking specifically for long sleeved tops that are cute and found this! pretty color pinky purple and my usual xs is perfect. i'm 5'6"", 127 lbs, 34b. love this--definitely unique and feminine. and--no--nary a smell in the mix!",4
"This skirt is gorgeous, sturdy, well constructed. i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy, but it was beautiful. it has a nice lining, flares into a pretty a line, and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit. i am normally a 2-4, and i bought the 4. it was a bit big, but the belt helped with that. i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments!",4
Love this top.!!! this is a very comfortable everyday top worn primarily with jeans. please make it in more colors. i think it should be less expensive.,3
"I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though, so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants, but wanted to let you kno",2
Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.,4
"This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to",4
I got several compliments when i wore this dress. it's very comfortable and will be great for fall.,3
"Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments, i'm expanding my comfort zone.",3
"Bought this somewhat on a whim during a promo in yellow, which is a lovely light cheery yellow (didn't make my pale skin look terrible). i love the detail of the dress and the swing silhouette. the slip is also of good quality. i don't love where the slip falls in the lace panel near the bust because it looks a little funny to me in a distracting way, but i'm keeping the dress. it's cute and fun :)",3
"I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store, its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall, the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this",4
"I love this little vest! such an easy outfit completer. just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voila...effortlessly chic! the colors pop and it's the perfect length. if you're on the fence with this one, definitely give it a try. you won't be disappointed!",4
"I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable.",2
"This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!",4
"Yep. this is snug, so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been",3
"I was skeptical about the contrasting color details on this blazer, and it turns out i was right to be. this blazer just looks like part of a prep school uniform, both in the colors and the fit, which is very boxy. maybe this is someone's style, but i just don't think it looks good.",3
"I liked this sweater's design, i like tunics. the sweater is a light weight knit.the sleeves are long. i got the green, which is lighter than the picture. the slit on sides go up about 18 inches from the bottom. the sweater is comfy, but a shirt is needed under or your ""love handles ""will be showing, if you have them. i also ordered the cream color, but it was more brownish than white, so i returned it.",3
"I love love love this dress! i am 5'4"" 117lbs and got an xs. it's just barely small on me but works great. it looks amazing and i can't always wear maxi dresses. they don't always work with my body type. this one is perfect. the color is gorgeous. i highly recommend this dress.",4
"Right on trend, easy to wear, but a bit snug in waist. which the vendor gave item specific sizing to make the selection of the size a bit easier.",3
"I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.",4
"I bought the cream version online, as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots, it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do, however, like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit, but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i",2
"Another reviewer said it best, ""i love the way this dress makes me feel."" i couldn't agree more. the lines are perfect and effortless. 
with all the different reviews on size, i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5"", 130, and have a small bust.",4
"I love the pattern and colors of this dress. the quality of the fabric is great. i initially ordered my usual size xs, but found it a bit roomy so i ordered both an xsp and an xxs. the xxs was more fitted and the xsp was too short in my opinion. i am still on the fence about the xs and the xxs. the xxs has a tighter fit, but it is also tight in the bust and i wonder how it will be if i have to reach for something - will it be too tight? even though the xs runs slightly big, i can still work with",3
"You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt.
colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove. (26.5 in waist, 35-36 in hips, 115 lbs).

length on the petite was above the knee, like show",4
I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.,4
"I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma",1
"This dress is well made, great fit, perfect a-line. the bust was lower cut than shown in the picture, but it fits well even with a large chest. completely flattering and i would highly recommend!",4
"The smallest size, xs, was big on me, i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape, doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though, but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green, made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.

for reference xs bog on 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.",2
A slip underneath makes this dress substantial. it's a good 'weather' transition dress-fall/spring. the lace is very pretty and it's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere. i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend.,3
"This shirt is really cute. it's shorter than most - and it's supposed to be that way. if you don't want your midriff showing if you stretch - this shirt isn't for you. it has slits on the side also. the material is super light so will be great for summer. i just loved the way it fit and that it's different. i ordered an xs and i'm about 5'5"" and 120 lbs.",4
"Very flattering, sliming and feminine. i particularly like the flutter sleeves. the fabric is a nice weight for fall.",3
"So, when i first found this dress it was already on sale and sold out in petites. for reference i am 5'2"" and currently weighing in at about 108, and my bust is a 32d. the store near my work has a petite shop (thank goodness) so i headed there after my day. they didn't have it in my size but they did have the regular sizing in a 0, which i promptly purchased.

the crossed part sits a little higher than my natural waist, but i think for someone with a slightly smaller chest it would hit spot on.",3
This is very practical. it goes with many things and is very comfortable....it can be worn with different leggings or with jeans! and it is well made! thanks retailer!,4
I have 3 pairs of these chinos i love them so much. they come soft like a well-worn favorite but are high quality at a great price. i'm typically a size 4. i bought the 26 size but think i could have gone down to a 25. otherwise very happy with this purchase!,4
These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.,4
Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.,4
I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that's why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!,4
I bought this shirt in a size small. it fits the same as it does on the model. it's a comfortable cute shirt. wish the other colors were available because i'd order another one.,3
"This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes, it does run large, but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm, it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside, but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?",2
These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.,4
"Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek, almost '90's style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers.",4
"Unfortunately this was too low cut for me,so i had to return it. i wish the neckline was higher. i could tug it up but it slipped right back down. the fabric is a perfect spring weight and the floral pattern is lovely. on me the ties, no matter how i fiddled, didn't cover the cleavage issue and i am a aa!",4
I absolutely love this piece. it's a beautiful and chic piece that is perfect for any occasion,4
"Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.",0
"This top is beautiful! it drapes just like the picture with gorgeous details in the back. this is what i expect from retailer! i am 5'4"", 120# and 34b and took my size small so i would say tts. i tried it on with a strapless nude colored bra and it was not visible. give it a try you won't regret it!",4
"This sweater is very warm yet light. the pink color is very cute, and the buttons are detailed very nicely! it hangs a bit low under the arms, and definitely tightens at the wrist. i ordered the xs size, and i find that i am unable to push the sleeves up. this is so beautiful and has a subtle uniqueness.",4
"Byron lars knows how to make you look like a woman with his magical dresses!  i decided to get the navy (i also own the sold-out marguerite aka carissima in bronze) instead of the black or white since everyone and their mother owns it already.  the lace of the top is different--more delicate but less intricate.  it's still very beautiful.    my body type is inverted and the dress is hourglass, so the size 8p fits great on top but loose on my hips and rear.  i'm going to keep this dress and do mo",4
"Love, love, love this dress. you can dress it up with high heels, or down with sandals . a mid weight material with seperate slip that serves as a lining . i am athletic , 5' 7"" and 132 lbs and bought a size small. i have broad shoulders , average waist , short torso , small hips and long legs. in the spring a denim jacket would look perfect with this dress.",4
"The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look. the fabric is smooth, not jean material. for me this is nice because though they have weight to them, the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down, much more versatile than jeans. these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely. i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these! i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel",4
Love this top. work appropriate and dress down worthy. i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist. comfortable fabric.,4
"True to size
neckline is not too low so it's great for work
got the red and it's a lush deep color
quite happy with this purchae",4
"Every time i turned around received another complement! it was perfect for a december wedding, great for a holiday party, and fit the bill for christmas eve. very comfortable and slimming. i'm still amazed at the number of complements received! the navy blue lace is elegant and comfortable, not scratchy like some lace. the ""v"" in back of the jumpsuit makes it easy to zip and unzip, i have some some imitations and thought i might have a problem zipping up the jumpsuit. not a problem! absolutely a",4
"The embroidery is gorgeous! it's a lovely blouse--soft, lightweight, and of quality material. the only problem is that it is an oversized fit--running at least one or two sizes too large. it is enormous! i ordered it online but will return it and shop for a much smaller size in the store to guarantee proper fit.",3
"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. 
retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.",4
"Love, love, love. like another chambray item i have, they feel stuff and rough after washing, but once you put them on, they soften up and look great.",4
"I absolutely love this light, soft cardigan. i don't think the pic does it justice. the black longer blouse takes away from it. i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments. only wish it came in additional colors.",4
Comfy. i bought the moss color i really like it. great causal pant for spring and summer,3
"This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.",0
"I didn't notice what some of the other reviews have said. i think it's very flattering, makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun. it is low cut in the bust, but not crazy. i'm a modest person and i'm comfortable with it. what i like best however it the cut of the top. it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge! the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun. it does run a tad large. i can go between a 2 and 4 in most retailer dresses and got",4
"This is a gorgeous piece-the pattern and color combination are classic fall. the sleeves for a xs/s are slightly short (i am 5'8"") but the rest of the fit is great. with the type of fabric and poncho-style, i would recommend wearing something underneath.",4
"I fell in love with this vest  the minute i saw it on the hanger.  it runs true to size and the material is excellent quality .  it looks great with jeans and a tee and also something dressier. i wore it over a navy blue wide-leg jumpsuit, and it looked truly amazing!  i  received so many compliments!  i also purchased the lace tie up top that it is featured with and can't wait for that to come in.",4
This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud! the material is amazingly soft and comfy.,4
Loved this sweater but too boxy,3
"Little clack dress. classic shape but is pretty low in the v neck. i am busty (34dd) and need a ""push-up"" bra to make the neckline close. it's very easy to wear and super comfy.",3
"Love this top--the material is very soft and though this isn't a thick tshirt, it holds its shape and supports the grommet detailing nicely. i'm 5'7"", about 130, not busty, and got a small--fits great! the color is more of an off-rose/blush (has more of a brown tint than the photo shows).",4
"I love this cardigan. i purchased it in the cream color. however, it did fray a bit after washing it. other than that, i think it was a great buy though!",4
"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3""",4
"I bought this on sale and absolutely love it. i bought the xs, i'm 5'10, 145 lbs and a b/c cup and it fit well. i am considering sewing in cups, since i don't like using stick-on bras as much and none of my other bras work with the back. that really is my only complaint about the dress, everything else is great!",4
"Beautifully detailed top that pairs well with dark denim. top is a bit wide, but i think that is the style. a unique and different piece to add to your wardrobe!",3
"I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good, not too right or lose. i took a size medium, which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me, also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.",4
"This is a very cute shirt with great details. however, it runs a little bit small. not as full cut as it seems.",2
"I am absolutely in love with this bathing suit and i want it in every color possible! i bought the black one last year and wore it all summer as no other suit that i already owned could compare. i get compliments on it every where i go. it's flattering, comfy and it's a one piece that doesn't make me feel frumpy. buy this suit!",4
If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!,4
"This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant, but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.",1
"The fabric is beautiful.  didn't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase.  as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly, stripes match nicely.  i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs, 34-28-35.  love the colors and the fabric, a nice cotton twill, lined, pockets, pretty bow belt.  i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker.  glad i have them !!",4
I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.,4
"I ordered this coat in the ""pink"" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)

one concern: since the wool is light",4
"I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale, thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee",0
Looking forward to wearing this on chilly spring mornings. ordered in the navy. fits true to size.,4
"This blouse is perfect for semi dressy occasions silver ribbon adds a nice, subdued sparkle accent and no need to add a camisole due to the nice lining.",3
"I saw this in the store, not on sale and loved it. was so happy when it went on sale! it is beautifully made and is soft and cozy.",4
"This is one of those dresses that hides on the rack until you see it. and you think, hmmm- this is really interesting. and then you try it on. and all the ladies in the dressing room say ""whoa"" yep, this is that dress. much more fitted and flattering on my 5'9"" 150lb frame. it oddly kind of alludes to 70's caftans. very cool.",3
"The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband, mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips, they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue, i would keep the trousers, as they are comfortable and pretty, and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through, as i feared.",2
"Great dramatic cardigan, wearable art, and not for the meek. i'll wear with a leather skirt and boots, jeans and boots, or a dress and boots. if the lack of closure at top bothers you, attach something --be creative. i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn.",4
"Love this t-shirt, its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs. 
the color is a little brighter than the picture.",4
"I love this, despite the split sleeves. the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt (from retailer) jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends. several people complimented me so it must have looked as i'd hoped. i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks, jeans and shirts. it is soft, feminine and comfortable...the ubiquitous ""dress it up or dress it",4
"Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6"" 135 lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size 4 regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material.",3
"I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person, more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look, size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good, although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos).

overall these are very nice. but there is one is",1
"I saw this top and immediately knew it was for me! i love it. and i disagree on it being one season too, i could see making this work all year, for sure. i love the green/gray color and it flows so beautifully, it's perfect! the back wasn't a problem for me, when wearing a normal bra i couldn't see my bra, maybe if this is a problem your bra is up too high on your back, i'm very petite and didn't have a problem with it. i bought a small, could have possibly used a xs but they didn't have it, but",4
"This dress is very beautiful and looks great on, however had to downsize one size.",4
"This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger, a nice blue, and a good transition piece. but, the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin, but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it, but sadly, i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms, i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work, but for me at least, i think it",2
Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.,1
"I think this top is great. it does show cleavage. also, it's very romantic. i can't wait to wear it. if only the store had had the red and wine colors in stock too.",3
I bought this dress as a pool/beach coverup but it is so cute i think i will also wear it other times as well. it is very comfortable and lightweight. perfect for the hot weather.,4
"The embroidery on this top is pretty but i think blue is more of a navy/grey in person and the embroidery seemed darker brown. i'm 5'6 and tried an xs and small, the small definitely fit better in length. the body of thr blouse is loose, almost boxy. cute top, just not what i'm looking for.",3
"This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality, but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big. 

the fit is tts, though slightly shorter then it looks on the model.",2
"I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately! i am petite (5'3""/36b/108 lbs) and purchased this in the only size left, which was a small. yes....it is very billowy (but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great!!) i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this! yay!! the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine!!! so very happy with my purchase! plan on wearing with jeans shorts/cropped jeans/",4
"Most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one! great cut, wish there were more color options.",4
"I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect, the cut was great, etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person, and sad that the slit came right to my knee, which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(",1
"I bought this cardigan online and loved it as soon as it arrived. i bought it on my usual small but it fit very big. this is a nice unusual looking cardi and has a very sporty style , so i wouldn't use it in the office. the material is very soft and slightly on the thin side. i am 5'4"" and 160lbs. i had to return it because the small was too big and couldn't find a xs at the store or online.. size down.",3
"Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.",4
"The longer back makes this one of my favorite pieces for fall. the navy blue pairs well with the floral accents on the back. this blouse is a little too sheer for my liking, but nothing a cami cannot fix.",3
"Bought these in 2p and i'm normally 0p in most pants. for reference, i'm 5'1 and 107 lbs and the 2 fit perfect! got many compliments on these pants",4
"Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!",0
"This dress is beautiful and very flattering! i bought the 8 and am 5'3"" and 138lbs. it fits right at the knee and is flowy, but still gives some shape without looking baggy. i love it!",4
"Bought this dress as a winter dress. it looks amazing, and even more so with some boots. love it. also, its more gray than blue, although i like that.",4
"The top itself is beautiful and colors are like pictured. my only issue was the size. i went for medium ( i'm usually m or l) and i'm 5'4"" so i can get away with regular and pettite. this top was way too long. looked like dress on me. i'm sending it back for exchange",3
"I received this coat as a 30th birthday present from my mother and i have to say, this is the best present she has ever bought me. the inside of the jacket is the softest sheerling i've felt and is pure bliss to wear around town. the coat is actually a lot warmer then i expected, which i'm not going to complain about. the print is lovely and i appreciate the faux leather edge on the cuffs, giving it a more finished look. the fit is fantastic. i'm a bit curvy and the cinched waist with the belt g",4
I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!,4
"Should have ordered the xl instead of the large. didn't even come close to being able to button the front but i'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small. beautiful soft green color, fabric is soft too. it is cropped to the waist. decided to return instead of reorder.",2
"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came",1
"I have about 3 or 4 akemi & kin tops. i usually take a small. i think this one runs a bit bigger. the armholes are too deep and there is just too much fabric for me. (5'6"" 125lbs) i am going to try to size down because i really like everything else about the top. orange is not my color but this has enough white to compensate. the pattern, button detail and fabric are all very nice.",3
I bought this top for my sister's birthday so the review is based on her opinion. she loved it and told me the embroidery was beautiful. she said it was tts. she also stated that the blouse was so versatile and could be worn dressed up or down.,4
"I purchased all the colors of this wonderful tee after receiving the first. it's machine wash and dry, and they've all held up well through multiple washes so far. the neckline and fit is flattering for a larger bust, due to the ribbing, but would be great on a more athletic figure as well. the fabric is soft enough that the 3/4 sleeves don't bug me, like some other tops do. all the colors are great and you'll want more than one! true to size.",4
"I ordered the petite in my size, since i'm well petite, but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately, for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits, but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.",2
"I love this top. the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy. the cut is fitted and flattering. the color of the fabric is ivory, not bright white. the embroidery is a good quality and doesn't easily fray. the fit is true to size. i highly recommend this top. i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute, always get compliments. it's very comfortable too.",4
This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.,1
"I usually wear an xs and in this i wore a small because on the bottom of the sleeve, it was tight. it's a great piece and i get a lot of compliments.",3
"Got the small petite. length is perfect, love the color, super comfy, very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top, so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits, if not it's going back. i'm 5',",3
How i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know. this is absolutely the best casual dress i've ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors. i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body. this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area. the drape of the willa complements my over large upper,4
"Given the price, i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric. the dress falls nicely and fits well, but the fabric is cheap... i have another maxi dress that i bought for like 20 bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric. 
 
i expect a lot more from a dress with this price. i'd recommend only buying on super-sale.",2
"The pictures online do not do this jacket justice. i saw it hanging in the store and had to have it, even before i tried it on. it's extremely versatile, worn as shown, as a layered look, or the zipped ""liner"" is can be removed and this can be worn as a simple blazer. it's the perfect weight for spring/fall. it's fitted, and so cute. this jacket runs true to size (not large). i usually wear a 4 and the small fit perfectly.",4
"The sweater feels nice, but not as luxurious as some cashmere. for the sale price, it is worth it. found it a bit small, but still wearable. hopefully it will hold up well, as the zipper seems a bit delicate. overall it is a good basic piece.",3
"I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l",4
"It is delicate and soft. the sleeves fit great on my 5'10"", 130lb frame, but the shoulders on the size small were too tight so i am exchanging it for a medium. the lining is unusual -- the front is fully lined but the back is only lined to the shoulder blades which is somewhat noticeable on the model. i would choose to wear a cami underneath for extra coverage.",3
"I purchased this jacket on pure impulse. to be quite honest it reminds me of a coat my dad used to wear, and i was halfway on the way to retailer when i decided to try it on. my goodness it's perfect. it's slightly oversized, delightfully 70's and makes everything look good skirts, pants, dresses etc. buy it, especially off the 70's have a special place in your heart.",4
"This is just the perfect sweater in my opinion. i got it in the rose, which is a gorgeous subtle color that will go with just about anything. i love the knit pattern and the buttons, and the sleeves are nice and long, which is crucial for me at my height (5'11""). overall i just see myself throwing this on over everything, so i'm sure i will treasure this for years to come!",4
Great sweater but it was just a little too short on me so it is going back. it is extremely fuzzy and soft though.,3
"Beautiful dress, skims the body perfectly and flatters. the silky and breathable fabric is everything-- it's made of cupro (used as a silk substitute but breathes like cotton-- uniqlo uses it in their ""airism"" products which makes it perfect for summer weather!). i wore it to a summer barbecue, dressed down with a denim shirt tied at the waist and simple jewelry, but can easily dress it up with a chunky heeled sandal and statement jewelry. it's gorgeous-- get it! 


the colors of the fabric a",4
"So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general, and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it, it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral, material is thick enough for fall, california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2"" (115 lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite, xs). i say go for it!",4
This sweater is a must have for fall!! super comfy yet stylish fit make it fun to dress up or down. i plan on wearing it with leggings and high boots!,4
"I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. also, the neckline is flattering and sexy without showing ""anything""! definitely can wear a normal bra",4
"I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was ""warm and cozy"" and not itchy at all, but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair.",1
"I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly, but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear, the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted, my inner thighs touch when i walk, but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown",3
I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.,4
"This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and i'm relatively slim in the hips.",3
"These are great-looking chinos and very comfortable. i'm 5'11"" and--unrolled--they are long enough for me.",4
Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling.,4
"Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf, not cute-short, just off. (i'm 5'8"" and 125#) to quote my husband, ""nope. not feeling these."" that said, they feel great on, seem to be made well, but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)",2
"If you know one.september and you know what's good for you, then size the heck down. maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter. any way, this dress is simply scrumptious! the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty. the layers are light and soft like silk (but it's rayon/poly) and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous. i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long. neckline features a slit-v with two hooks to close if wanted. co",4
"This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color, perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.
fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in",4
"In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges, which looks rather cheap and sloppy.",2
"Very cute and comfortable!does run big, i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time.",4
"I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it's so soft, fits tts & i just can't wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!",4
I bought this for the office and received many compliments about it. it puts the outfit together just right and the material is very comfortable. it fits my need for comfortable clothing that still looks good enough for a business setting. this jacket is more comfortable (almost slouchy) than it is structured.,3
"Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back",1
Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!,1
"I thought these were very nice bermuda shorts. i have skinnier legs and i didn't see a problem with them being too baggy there. the olive color was nice, very comfortable material.",3
"I walked into a hair salon wearing this dress, and everyone who walked by complimented me. to me, that's a definite winner! i got the blue color, and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively. the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus. this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should. there's no static or clinging where there shouldn't be. i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off, but i absolutely love it.",4
"Dig this top but a little different from what i was expecting. the outside is indeed a bit stiff and scratchy but it is lined ... but definitely would've appreciated a softer fabric. however, the cut is cute and flattering and the pattern is adorable so it's staying in my closet. perhaps not the thing to wear to snuggle up with someone though!",3
"I wasn't sure i would like this top, but wanted something different, than what i already own. i ordered it in an xs (my usual size) and it is slightly loose (which i knew it would be based on the cut). it looks great with jeans or shorts. i purchased the black and white striped one because it looks more interesting. the ties may drive me crazy- we'll see. i like the weight of the fabric, i just hope it doesn't pill. for reference, i am 5'3 and 123lbs. i usually wear a 2/4.",3
"The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.",1
"This dress is to die for. it's exactly as pictured, beautiful quality and extremely flattering. all the lace and lining make it a slightly heavier dress - i can imagine it getting really warm after a while in the summer sun. but it would absolutely be worth the bit of sweat to wear this gorgeous dress.",4
This dress fits great and is very warm for the winter months.,3
"Great sweater coat.  fits a bit large.  purchased a small...which is unusual for me.  i normally wear a medium or sometimes a large.  retailer clothes are mosly cut small.  it looks great on...warm, comfy and attractive.  i am very pleased with this purchase.  highly recommend.",4
So much cuter than the picture. i bought a m and i'm a 34c i thought it was comfy n flattering,4
Beautiful colors. lovely style. feminine and has a nice flow. fiattering fit in back also. nice holiday blouse. really very pretty.,4
"When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10"" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute.",0
"Based on other reviews that this top ran large, i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size), and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats, so the bottom of this top really, really, really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin, and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.",2
"I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.",0
"This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10"" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!",3
I would say that this blouse runs 1-2 sizes too small. the fabric is unique - it's like gauze backed by fine netting - and the workmanship is excellent.,3
Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.,4
Great cut and high quality fabric. the top gives you a nice hourglass shape and i love the way it hangs half-way down your butt.,4
"I ordered this in the blue motif and the print is really fun. the orange is even brighter in person. at 5'8"" 130 lbs the small has more than enough room and is a bit longer than some of the other offerings lately.",3
"I love this tee, i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.",4
"I fell in love with this jumpsuit at first sight. the color is stunning and very striking. i found it to run a bit large, so would suggest sizing down for optimal fit, but all in all a great piece for summer that will transition nicely into early fall.",3
"I stalked the website to get this in a pxxs. it runs a tad large. this is a beautiful garment. i receive many, many compliments every time i wear it. in fact, nearly everyone comments on it. it is surprisingly warm for a cape. i love that it works so well over my bulkier sweaters. as others have mentioned, the buttons are a little difficult, but i found that they got easier with multiple wearings. i disagree with the reviewer that feels the collar must be worn up. i actually like the collar down",4
"I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite, but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.",4
"Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy, polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening, with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down, it looks great with a denim jacket, then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short, sandals, pumps, you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone, loosely tied, or done in a bow. leggings or ti",4
I found this dress to be shapeless on (even when the belt was tied). i love the tshirt material and the fact it has short sleeves. it's just too boxy.,3
"I like the lace-up trend, but most designs are too revealing. this shirt is super sexy, but not immodest. i bought it in black and am now buying another color. to me, the fabric feels soft and thick, very nice.",4
"Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero, it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this, but mind the size of the slip in the petites range, and also it is aqua.",1
"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering.",1
"The best thing about these pants is the material. if you are expecting a bleached denim-material, these are not for you. these are far better. they are extremely soft and have some give to them but not so much that they stretch out while wearing them (as guaranteed on the tag). although, because they are a less rigid material, the pants do show stretching as can be seen at the knee area in the photo. if you normally get short-sized pants, the regular fit will fit like regular non-ankle pants but",3
"Ordered this top the second i saw it!
i wear a small or med. depending on the cut and fabric............noticed it is cotton and went with a medium.
so happy i went with the larger size.......runs very small, especially in the chest, and there is no give in the fabric.
stunning top but would go up one, possibly two sizes.",4
"This sweater dress is very beautiful in person. the colors are very ""fall"", i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality. as for the fit, it runs fairly true to size, maybe slightly small. i tried on my usual medium, but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a size 6. this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person!",4
"Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun, but not too much.",3
"Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.

oh well, it's going back!",2
"Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed.",0
I couldn't tell on line this top has gold metallic thread running throughout. i find metallic thread to be itchy. when i first put it on i thought it might be o.k. i can tolerate a fair amount of itch in fabric. after about 5 minutes i suddently couldn't wait to get it off. seemed like the longer it was next to my skin the more irritating it became. it is also a bit thinner fabric than i expected. i was hoping to use it as a layering piece. it would work well for layering if it was comfortable.,3
This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.,0
This runs large. i usually wear a m so i ordered the m/l. reordering in next size down and hope that helps. i gave it 5 stars because the knit is beautiful and quality looked great.,4
"I'm 5'6'' , athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.",2
"I saw this online, visited my local retailer, found it! it is the most beautiful shade of blue, nicely textured material! i am 5'7"" and 148 pds, i bought the xs and it fits perfect! definately designed for us smaller busted gals!",4
"I tried this top on in the store and didn't buy it because i was in a hurry. obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back. so happy i was able to get it online, it's beautiful. i got a medium and it fits perfectly, enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy, i'm typically a medium in shirts at retailer. it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants. i wear a cami underneath. i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great, i just didn't feel comfortable",4
"I got the xs and it fits perfectly, almost an a line cute slightly fuller on the bottom, not too form fitting and not too loose. i am 5'1"" and the length is not short as it appears in the photo on the model. the yellow flower pattern is super cute. material is soft and comfy.",4
"Like others reviewers mentioned on here, this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me, as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame, but for tall, busty, and curvier girls, it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.

however, i'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel",2
"Lovely top, very rich looking, i always get compliments. it's loose fitting but not baggy and the embroidery is well done.",4
Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.,2
"I purchased the blue, and i love the style and fit of the shirt. i worry a bit about the slit showing too much cleavage in certain positions, but my friends have assured me that it is work appropriate. very flattering, and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it.",4
"Really cute top! love the ruffle detailing and the pattern. quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer. either way, i'm happy with the top. got my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it's meant to be a looser top so i don't mind that it runs a little bigger.",4
"I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted, they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.",1
"Hi, i bought these in both colors. the material is very nice. for me the only part of the pants that stretched was the waistband. sadly i had to return them.",4
"This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size, but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5'9"". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric, although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it.",2
Cute top. i always get compliments when i wear it. a little boxy in style,3
"Finally a jumper that works for me! i am 5'6 but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way. this one is perfect. the material is light and perfect for warm weather. the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes. i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under 5'8"" because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf. i can't say enough good things about this jum",4
"Love this top.
the fit is perfection!
the fabric is wonderfully soft.
i ordered the green, love this color.
will be ordering it in the grey also..
fits very true to size.",4
"So i was super excited to get this skirt, unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured, it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier, i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re",2
"But, saldly, no....i tried the multicolored version in a size m and l. the fabric is almost good, though a touch sheer and perhaps problematic for washing. the real issue, though, is the fit.
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, high waist
i typically wear a m in a knit top, but the waistband was tight and not forgiving. i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist. when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be (longer) it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my",2
I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!,3
"This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model. the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms you're going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out. it's made of a light weight linen-cotton fabric. it's very soft and doesn't wrinkle as easily as most linen does, it feels soft on the skin, light-weight, and has a nice bounce to it. it's",4
"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i bought my usual size 4 and it fit perfectly. like other reviewers said, this is a very fine corduroy fabric. the thicker fabric really helps smooth any bumps and bulges, and the a-line skirt was flattering. overall i liked this dress, but the color didn't do much for me. because it just wasn't ""wow"" on me, i found little things to nitpick. the bodice is very flattering, but the way it cuts in shows bra-straps (",3
"While the white version is a tad more twee, this one in black is edgier, more sophisticated. tts for my 33"" chested, broad shouldered self in a 4. all the unique details add up to an outstanding, versatile piece: how it blouses out in back; opaque enough to wear without a cami; the scallops?i may keep both colors!",4
"Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size, too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase",4
"I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute, easy top to wear, but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming, which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally, i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.",1
"I bought this in a size 0 which is my usual retailer size. the lace is nice quality, not rough or scratchy. i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look ""vintagey"". it will be perfect for the holidays or all fall/winter. i like that the peplum doesn't seem to flair out much. very pretty!",4
"This sweater is the reason i shop at retailer - unique, cute & comfy! the yellow really isn't 'one of my colors' but it's so different that i had to get it. and the cut is so flattering, that i had to go back to get the purple! it may run a tad bit generously; i'm 5'4"", 124 lbs, 34d and originally got the small. i wound up returning and getting the xs. that sizing was slightly more form-fitting, without being clingy.we had a hint of fall weather in colorado, so i immediately threw the yellow versi",4
"I'm 5'8"" about 134, somewhat of a pear, and these jeans in size 28 fit like they were made for me. plus, the fabric is really soft and comfortable and i love the color. ankle opening is more straight than skinny, which is a change from my usual skinny jeans, but i like it.",4
"This sweater is perfect for fall...it's roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops.",4
"This sweater is light gray, as shown in the photo, not dark gray as the description states. i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small. it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl.",4
"Good quality material. i got size 10 which is a little too big - size 8 would probably be better. very pretty, feminine top. a little too full in the waist/skirt area.",3
"I bought these last year and loved them, however they came in tall sizes. this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short, even at 33"". im 5'7"" and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg. i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal",1
"I love these pilcro pants. i had them in two colors, both beige and khaki. super comfy, and they stretch out a little around the waist with wearing. however, i recently ruined both sets in the wash because i used a stain-stick remover to try to get some grease spots out of them. the stain stick instead lifted the dye off of them! now i have two sets of pants with odd light splotches on them...so sad they aren't more color-fast :(",4
"I love, love this trench! i bought the grey, and it goes well with so many other pieces! i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend. it's a great layering piece for the san francisco weather i'm adjusting to!

it does run a little big, but i don't mind because it gives enough room for layering. i'm short at 5'3 but still stuck with a small-- a small petite probably would look great as well!

hei hei consistently makes great jackets/trenches :)",4
"Ordered this on a whim, in my normal size large, and so glad i did. it's just beautiful. the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers. it has a soft, fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual. the 3/4 sleeves have elastic. it just flows nicely over the body and isn't oversized like so many tops. there's a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back. it's a beauty.",4
"I saw this on the rack, and tried it on because it was just so beautiful. the beading and embroidery details are unlike any piece of clothing i've seen in a ready-to-wear store. it feels and wears much more like a couture piece.
i wasn't planning on making such a big purchase, but it's just so beautiful i had to have it. i doubt i'll find another item of such quality and craftsmanship for the price.
runs large- i'm normally a size 6 (135lbs) and the size 4 fit perfectly.",4
"Gorgeous dress and very flattering but it does run quite small in the bust (i'm 32 dd) and even the shoulder area (i rarely have problems there). i also find the side zipper a pain. sized up from a 2p to a 4p. the lace detail is especially beautiful and the color is more peachy than pink, the print quite saturated and not too pastel for early fall. i can see wearing it for 3 seasons, at least in ca.",4
"Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!",4
"Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6"" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la",1
"I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!",4
"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos, the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit, i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7"", 128# with a very small",4
"I bought this tee in gray and i liked it so much, i got the pink as well. it is not see through or sheer in either of the colors that i purchased. for reference, i am 5'2"" and the shirt hit at low hip. i ordered one size up for a""swing"" look. very fresh, fun take on the basic tee. love it!",3
I got the jacket in the gray. it's a pretty pretty shade of gray. it's soft and feels really good on. it's short. like hits at the waist. i have long arms and the small for perfect which i was very pleased.,4
"This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.",4
Was hoping i was going to love this top and i did. its a fun piece to dress up or down.,3
"Really interesting, beautiful colors. i found it to be short, even in the regular size (and i'm 5'1 with a short torso). wish the fit was slimmer, but i could see it working with jeans, or being stunning with a black ball skirt.",3
"I am obsessed with these shorts. i bought blue ones last year and loved them so much i needed another pair. i purchased the gray ones and they are a beautiful hue, even with my pale legs. i think they will be very versatile. the fit is perfect!! hits at just the right length to be flattering and appropriate, not too short. super comfy. i am fuller on the bottom so shorts are tough to find, and these are truly amazing. i can't wait to wear them when it gets warmer! for reference i am 5' 4"" about",4
"I took a risk on this one. i wasn't sure if the shirt was more green or more blue. i look better in blue. it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green, but i think it still looks good! i'm 5'3' and 125 lbs. i got a medium. i could have maybe gotten a small, but i like the medium. the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it, which i like. all in all good.",3
"I don't usually pay full-price for retailer clothes, but i had a 20%-off coupon and i decided to give this dress a try, as it irradiated a happy vibe and reminded me of books and dress-up clothes from my childhood. i don't regret it one bit! the colors and the print are absolutely beautiful and i love how they mix up and contrast in a subtle way. i really like the long sleeves with the elastic at the wrist. the cord at the waist hangs with a fun mix of tiny beads, faux mini crab claws, and faux mi",4
Very pretty sweater! i love the bell sleeves with the design on the sides. the sweater runs a bit short though and wish it hung a little longer. looks great with flare jeans and boots!,3
I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.,1
"I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8"" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo. (i used a 20% coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top -",4
I would never had bought this top if i hadn't seen it previously in the store. the look in the picture is not flattering at all (too frumpy with the wide pants). the many details work well with pastel tones. very bohemian look so make sure you balance that with modern bottoms and edgy shoes. might be a problem washing it because all of the details: mini pearls and golden thread but you got to do what you got to do...,3
"Flattering cut, the tie neck is very nice, but definitely needed the petite for me, regualr size went too low. the striping is a nice flowey thin fabric in grey and navy, with a bit of texture in ti, not sure it is obvious from the picture. length in eptite went right below my knee, but in a goood spot. overall, loved it, but returned in hopes it hits sales one day (jsut spending too much latetly)...",4
"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8"", 180lbs, 36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!",2
This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!,4
I love these pants! they fit perfectly and are great for casual days at work. great quality too! love!!!,4
"I wanted to love this top. unfortunately, the color & fit didn't work for me. i'm a 36ddd. the fit was ok, it even flattered my bust, i just felt the stripes didn't flatter my waist. this would be perfect for an athletic frame.",3
"I was walking to the fitting room and i saw two of this dress on a rack- an xs and small. i could tell by looking at it that it runs small, so i grabbed a small to try on. i didn't want to love this dress (it's expensive), but i did. it is so pretty and flattering. i wish it were an inch or two longer, but it's ok. with tights in the fall will be fine. not sure i would wear this to work, as i am a teacher and it is too short for me. it definitely runs small. i am between a 2 and a 4, so i took t",4
"Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big.",4
"Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.

got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.",1
"These are the perfect way to battle the california heat in style- more beautiful than on the picture. you can't see, but there are gold threads running through the fabric. pair with a sandal and a flow top, and i'm good to go!",4
"I really liked the lace up details and embroidery. the sleeves were too long for me and i was not a fan of the elastic on the sleeve...made it tough to push sleeves up. i took to my seamstress and her cut elastic out and hem the sleeve. 
now its perfect!",3
"Absolutely love this dress. it is perfect for the summer. yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is. the style is so unique, love the pleats. i am 146lbs, 5'6"" 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly. not tight through the arms holes or the bust area. the dress hangs perfectly, you can dress it up or where it to run errands.",4
"I was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look. i am usually an xs or s, depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesn't drape well. i barely got my arms into the sleeves. i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child's size?  i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off. size up 1-2 for comfort if you have to have this girl. i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try. returned.  for ref:",2
"I love this jumpsuit. i've worn it twice and received many compliments both times. absolutely gorgeous. i couldn't be happier. 5'5"", 135, 34c-6.",4
"This skirt arrived today and i love it. the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day. i plan on wearing it with tights and/or boots. the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters. it's not ""pull on styling"". it has a side zipper. fits true to size, but is longer on me than the model, but then i am pretty short. got this on sale!!",4
"I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color,  which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top, but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small",3
"First off, this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.",1
"These pants are my favorite! not only is the fit slimming and perfect, but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them. i absolutely love these, well worth the money.",4
Cute to wear with leggings. i like that it's easy to just throw on. it's fitted at the top and easy to chase kids around but doesn't look too momish or sloppy.,4
"I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version, but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale. 

i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.",2
"I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large, but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style, it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly, plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of ""cozying up"" in colder weather by wrappi",4
"Although it was a bit of a battle with my bra straps, it was completely worth it for date night. hot shirt! very comfy and quality fabric. next time, i may just pin or tape my straps...",3
"Cute jacket, but size didn't work on me. 5'4, 135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops, but m in jackets. ordered the medium, but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer, but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.",3
"I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs, as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult.",4
"I don't know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didn't work. it was too wide across the breastline, i think, creating a boxy shape that just didn't look flattering. outside of that, the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made. i was sad to send it back, especially at the sale price.",2
"This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.",3
This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.,4
"I wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering. it's cute, but very casual and very thin material...not like other retailer tops. also runs super small. i ordered a small (i wear a small or xsmall at retailer) and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews.",2
Like this top. it's not too thin but still remains cool. too bad it has to be hand washed.,3
"I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that's just hanging there?  it's a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn't  look good hanging, and it doesn't look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i'm definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference, i am 5'5"", 135, 34c and a small was perfect.",1
"Sizing is just getting unreasonable, and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model, but on my 5' 4"" 115 lb frame, the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally, the shirt looked like it shrunk in length, and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22"" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i",1
I'm not sure why this skirt is described online as having a blue motif. the background is black and the blue in the pattern could pass as grey. the material is a strong polyester which should be nice and easy to clean but it almost feels like silk. i love the aline and even with the ruffles it looks very slimming on this pear-shaped gal. i can see wearing it with strappy sandals and a light blouse in the next few weeks but pairing it with a sweater and boots well into the fall and winter. i thin,4
"I bought 2 of these in peach and maize. the fabric is yummy and soft as silk, the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great, however there is too much fabric! if only a bit less, the fabulous swing shape would work. that said, i'm keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors. i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house, if sale was on sale again.",3
"I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i'd never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i'm still hoping it's not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for",3
"I was really nervous when ordering this dress because of the other reviews, but i couldn't get to a store during the mother's day event and really wanted this little number. it arrived yesterday and i'm already so excited to wear it, especially once i get just a tiny bit of a tan. i love the fact that it is yellow and white stripes with the dragonflies on top--the pattern is so much cuter in person than it appears online. the fabric is also a good weight, and it is lined, which greatly simplifie",4
"This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for",0
"This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it, even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8"" 130 lbs and bought the small",4
"I was very pleasantly surprised by the beautiful, intricate threaded material of this shirt! it takes the shirt from a casual top to an intricate and unique piece in my closet that can be dressed up or down. the top is definitely larger than i expected - i wear a size small (ordered a small) and it's very wide (lots of extra material) as it falls! i checked it to see if i had accidentally received a large when it first came. it looks like a baby doll shirt, with the shirt getting wider and more",2
"Beautiful summery dress with bright fun print. i think this was well worth the sale price i paid. it lays nicely and is flattering. i went down a size from my normal 8 to a 6. however as other reviewers have said, the arm holes/halter top is too blousy and no matter how tight i tied it or type of bra i wore, you can see bra on the sides. i'm going to get this tailored and then it will be perfect. can't wait to wear this on my vacation!",3
Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!,4
"True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue ""jeans""; perfect outfit for almost all occasions.",4
"I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a",0
"This is a beautiful dress. however, it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also, i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person.",0
"Love it! i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium. i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly. it is sitting pretty in my closet now. :) so if you are a size small, try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well.",4
"Just recd the neutral & navy in the size s, my usual size in tops at retailer. just a heads up - it's way oversized under the arms. in the fashion world probably falls under the category of a dolman style sleeve. also the fabric is nubby like/pilled look. similar fabric is the 'warm-up pullover' that i recently saw at the store. i have a feeling this may be a new trend. if you are ok w/ the oversized underarms & nubby fabric then order up. if hesitant, wait & visit the store... i love the look of",3
"Very soft fabric. does begin to ball up due to boucle material, very common",3
"Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress, but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite, also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit, but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.",2
Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.,3
"I found this during the tag sale this year. great classic hacking jacket that still feels modern thanks to the cut (a bit shorter) and bright metallic buttons. i got it in a light grey which will work well with many outfits. heads up to curvy short waisted girls, this blazer really worked well for me due the shorter length and great waist placement. really flattering. it does seem to run a bit small, particularly in the sleeves and shoulders so i sized up which also allows for layering underneat",3
"I don't normally write reviews, but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus, they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5, 135 and medium is perfect.",4
"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",1
"Beautiful dress, i like the length and cut. nice material. runs a bit big. i think it'll look nice with a belt. great colors.",4
I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.,1
"I have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size 6 to a size 10-12, but this dress makes me look & feel skinny again. i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure. it is true. thanks to this dress i look like my old self, and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time. you can wear this dress from day to night, you can dress this up or down. it looks great with a jean jacket and high-tops, or high-heeled booties with a n",4
This is a super comfortable and flattering dress and i get compliments every time i wear it! highly recommend!,4
"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way",2
"This jacket fits just a tad big, but it's quite comfortable. it's the perfect touch to dress up jeans! i've gotten lots of compliments.",3
"I liked the product shots of this cardigan, but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting, the fabric was rougher, the lace was scratchy, the fit was boxy, and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute, but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale, but for now it goes back...",2
"I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated, it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.",0
Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.,4
"I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!",4
"I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it's a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w",4
"Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.",4
These pants fit great. the velvet material is a sleek look . these pants can be casual by day and are easily dressed up in the evening.,4
"This dress was one of those incidental finds i saw in-store while making an online return. for whatever reason i didn't notice this one online but loved it in person. the fit is easy going and flattering, i took a small as the shoulder fit would've been a little tight in the xs. great dress for transitioning seasons :)",4
"I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.

at first glance, i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim",0
Love how these fit! they are warm and such a good price! i got 3 pairs. i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine. i hung them dry.,4
I tried this on in a m - it fit tts aside from the fact that there were super long. very form fitted and flattering.,3
Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.,2
Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!,4
"It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it, but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.",4
This skirt is a great fit for curvy women. i highly recommend it.,4
"Love this shirt, can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!",4
"This was a miss for me. the armholes are too low, it's lined and heavy. way too long. just didn't wow me. the lace is sturdy and beautiful, though.",3
"I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result, i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo, but still beautiful.",3
"Lovely socks, great color, stitched well, a little thin",4
"I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough, unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well, rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut, great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!",2
"When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9"" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.

i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!",4
My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.,4
I love these jeans! the perfect amount of stretch. very figure flattering. perfect for lounging around or a night out.,4
"This little number is really cute, i got it on sale, after i looked at it, went home, slept and decided i had to go ack for it:-0
i will wear it with trouser jeans and a blazer for work, or jsut jeans and boots for casual wear.",4
"Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures, and it has a lovely quality in person, the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on, and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips, large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.",2
"I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.

i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p",2
"Flattering, flirty, bright, beautiful romper. i wish it come in other colors because i want more!!!!",4
"I love this shirt so much i bought it (nearly) full price with my birthday month discount!
get it! i purchased the red and also like the black/white polka dots - hangs beautifully,
feels heavenly and polished and fun at the same time. i bought the medium am generally
a medium.",4
I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size.,3
"I like this blouse very much but my work is extremely conservative so i chose to return it. it really pops, even though it is just black and white. it has some sparkles in it.",3
This dress is gorgeous! i bought the patterned dress and it has the perfect colors for the season. the pictures just do not do it justice. plus it is incredibly comfortable. this dress could easily be dressed it up or down and is perfect for someone who is curvy on top. i can't wait to wear this on a date!,3
The tie neck is super on trend. this will go great under a jacket or cardi. it's a keeper.,4
"This top is great - lightweight and flattering.
i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. 
i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.",4
I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.,2
Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.,3
"This dress is really lovely in person. the fit was perfect and the length not too short. for reference, i'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit! (i'm an xl usually, and the fit was tts) the only thing i'm not crazy about is the slip, it's more of a flesh toned color. i'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these, retailer!",4
"This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined, but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim, which means i have large shoulders, and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion, well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long, and as usual, retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system, so if you choose to close this cardigan, it just looks awful.",1
"I got these jeans on sale and have been very happy with them. they seem to go with everything - just a really nice basic skinny jean to have. lightweight with a little bit of give. they fit tts for me, and hit about an inch and a half longer on my legs than the model in the picture (i'm 5'6""). i've had them for a couple of months now and keep expecting them to show some wear in the knees bc of how often i wear them. not yet! any marks on them have come off easily in the wash. overall, very happy",4
"I rarely write reviews on here, but this coat deserves a mention.

i have wanted a trench coat for a long time, but my build and coloring are not flattered by the traditional beige/khaki coat or cut. i leapt when i saw this one and immediately ran to my local store to try it on.

it is not *really* a rain coat, but more like a charming layer in the style of a coat. it's lightweight, soft fabric that swings really well - but also gets slightly wrinkly. the color is lovely and the buttons are",3
I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.,4
"The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality, but designed poorly. returned it.",1
"This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried the xs.",2
"Never thought i would buy a jumpsuit, but this one is gorgeous. i put true to size. i ordered a m and a l. i kept the l because i like the looser fit. weigh 150# and am 5' 6 1/2"" tall. i carry any extra weight at my waist and the l just looked better. i almost always wear a m in retailer clothes. love the feel of it and the way it looks on me. really looking forward to wearing it. on sale it is a great buy.",4
"The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2), but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable, breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!",3
"I have been looking for a vest this winter and i saw this one online. i am a huge fan of swing tops. i don't care for super fitted clothes. the knit says part wool so i was expecting it to be a little scratchier, however when i got it, it is so soft and more cotteny feel to it than wool but has the warmth of wool when wearing it. i really have to try not to wear it everyday. just love this vest! it's my favorite purchase this season. i am a size 10 in tops and i can either do a med or a large. i",4
"I saw this in my local store and i fell in love with the bird pattern flowing down the right side of the shirt. for me, i bought the xs and the fit was great. i usually take a true s. the sleeves have a pulled stitching running down them and the top has nice shaping and flare to it. it is a wonderful little tee! the fabric is linen and not as soft as cotton but in this case it is not an issue as the tee does not cling to you.",4
"Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress. i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so i'd better listen up. and because i really like the other bailey 44 dress i own. wow! i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this. i love it, my husband loves it and it's comfy. for reference i did size down and went with a petite. had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on",4
"I wore this dress to my work christmas party and got compliments all night! it's a beautiful dress with fantastic details, and it is very comfortable. i am 5' 5.5"" and about 122 lbs. i am typically a 0 on top, 2 waist, and 2-4 bottom. i ordered the 2 and it was the right choice for me. it was a little snug on the bum and around the thighs (it pulled ever so slightly in the front) but it still looked good. it's stretchy without looking like it is stretchy. the top part of the dress fit well, and",4
"This windowpane coat is so striking -- and it looks even better on than in the photos. i love it!! it has great styling, including the button placement & the beautiful fall brown lining. it is quite warm over a thin sweater, the fabric is amazingly soft. i get a lot of compliments on it! two friends have already purchased it. i normally might take a 12, but a 10 was just fine. this is a great coat!!",4
"This is a gorgeous blouse, but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs, and i'm trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small, and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely, just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse.",4
I ordered the blouse in black. it's not quite black but maybe in between a brownish gray. very pretty color. it fits just right. would have like it just a tad longer.,3
"I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well, maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2"" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!",4
"My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower, and of all the lingerie i received that day, this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.",4
Such a cute skirt. it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty. it fits well and it is true to size.,4
I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.,2
"This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs, bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!",4
"I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i'm normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however, it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool, cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th",2
"I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true, it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.",2
"I got this jacket thinking it was going to look different on me. while i ended up returning it, it fit me nicely and was good quality. it just wasn't the look i was going for.",3
"This dress fits me perfect. the only complaint i have is that it was a little snug around the neck every now and then. it was a little snug getting in and out of the dress too. overall, the design is beautiful and it is definitely my new favorite.",4
"This romper is so cute and comfy! the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots (true to the photos). i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso, but this fits great, with shorts hitting about the same as the model image (i'm 5'7""). i really love the v-neck on this too - it's simple, but a really flattering cut that i don't think would expose even ladies with a larger chest. definitely a nice everyday piece - excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa",4
"Tried this on in the store, very soft and hangs well, better on, than the hanger. needless to say i bought it!",3
"This top also caught my eye in my local store, and being a devoted deletta lover, i had to buy. it is a straight, slim fit, so i bought a medium, instead of my usual small, to glide over my curvy lower half. it's thin, finely woven knit, with two cute little buttons at the top of the side slit; the cut and longer length in the back is very flattering. i bought the heathered black and have worn with my black pilcro leggings; it's a great top to wear over leggings or skinny jeans; no belts with th",4
"This dress is simply unique   beautiful! i said it runs large, but that only because the bodice is a little looser than anticipated. i decided to stick with my normal size 0 though so i could have a little extra room. for those wishing for a tight fit, size down. i love the colors in this dress; i typically shy away from bright colors and pinks but paired with the muted yellow/brown",4
I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to get the best quality and fitting dresses from retailer!,4
"I bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory. i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk, but this sweater creates a long, lean look. it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans, and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail. every time i wear this, i get compliments on it.",4
"This is a really adorable top!normally i shop online, but ended up in a store today. i bought it instantly, but never would have purchased this based upon the pictures. as all the other reviewers have said, this does run small and you need to size up, especially if you are busty for your size. i am a 4 or a small  (34c) in just about everything, but had to go to a medium. the sleeves attach too far out on the front of the top, restricting arm movement. thankfully, i didn't see a significant size",3
"I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.",0
"I ordered a large, and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me, it was not. it ran a little small on top, buttons bulged at my chest, and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some, just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.",2
I love the way this top fits and the way it flows. i have it in two colors.,4
This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.,1
"Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight, i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely, so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.",2
This jacket is a flattering although somewhat boxy. it does run large - i wear a medium and ordered a small. fits perfect. looks great with jeans and a t-shirt.,3
"This jacket fits great! i got a medium, and am 5'6"" , 140 lbs. very nice light weight jacket.",4
"I am not sure why this is listed on the website at hd in paris, because i purchased this shirt in carmel, ca and it is actually maeve, which is a brand i buy often and always fits me well. this piece did not disappoint. this is a fun and versatile black top, but has a little edge with its design and i know that i will get a lot of use out of it. i don't find the fabric to be ""rough"" at all, but it is textured which i just think adds to the interest of this piece. i am a 34d and did not find my c",4
This dress is so pretty!! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it. make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress' design.,3
"This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned -- and i am kind of a dress person. this one has beautiful detailing -- sheer sleeves, but the bodice and bottom half are lined. fits beautifully -- i am a little busty, so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open, but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed, which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress. i am 5'6"" and the length was just right, abou",4
These are form fitting and have a great wash. the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear. the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots.,3
"The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty, but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest, it was very unflattering.",2
"I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!",4
"Doesn't fit as tight/as slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture, definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight!",2
"I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person. 
as for sizing, i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine, although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue",2
"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors, fabric, and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",2
"Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top, lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.",2
I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it's 100% cotton i probably couldn't probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine.,4
"I've been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants. i'm very particular and have turned down every pair until these. these are perfect! they fit true to size. they are a relaxed, but not baggy cut. (i hate saggy butt pants!) the legs are slightly tapered so they don't widen my frame. they look great rolled up or left down. the linen is soft, not scratchy. the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist. they are also not see through! (a must for me!) i ordered th",4
"This is a really cute skirt, and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also, the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to",3
"This top looks as pictured on the model. the color is great and true to the pictures with the light faded spots, which i really like and make it more interesting. however, i am on the fence about keeping it due to the itchiness of the fabric. the itching is mainly on the arm holes as it is tight to the skin. i wanted this top for when i'm feeling a comfy casual look. however, i'm not sure how comfy i'll be if i'm itching. i may over look the scratchy fabric as the color and fit of the top are gr",3
"Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i",4
"This dress is so versatile. the knit top is nicely structured and the flowy skirt is forgiving and flattering. i bought the white, gray and poppy colored one, and i think it's smashing.",3
"After being tentative to splurge on skinny jeans (i've always been a small flare jean-girl), i am thrilled to say i love these jeans. the rise is perfect in that it ""holds in"" anything you want ""held in"" and makes a slim shirt look even better. i have worn them with booties and regular boots alike and have no complaints. i was unsure of the jean's claim to not stretch out but have been pleasantly surprised at how they have kept their shape...even after sitting for many hours at a time. wash cold",4
"I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great, soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.",2
"Agree with the positive reviews. this fits nicely with my casual lifestyle. i ordered an xl in the grey although i generally wear a large. it's a bit oversized with plenty of room for layering. it does bulge a bit in the back but the knit waistband still hits just below my waist. the only drawback is that the sleeves are a bit wide, long and loose at the wrist. it's lined in the body with a soft fleece. the sleeves aren't lined but have a soft silky fabric in the cuffs so easily rolled, adding i",3
"I absolutely love this top, i purchase this brand frequently because the designs are simple, yet unique and cool. i'm 5'7"" 170 lb.s curvy/athletic and i got this in a medium, it fits perfectly and looks really great on! i love the asymmetric cut and raw hem... wish it came in more colors!",4
"The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute, however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.",2
"This top came down to my hip bones, but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for ""regular"" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26"" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice, and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing, i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model, but n",2
"This dress is beautiful, i usually wear a 6 or 8 and i ordered a 4, it is huge, i will be returning.",3
"So this top is kind of short, but that is pictured. it hits right where it does in the photo, which i like. it is a sheer material, not terribly so, but you will most likely need a cami, which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you don't like the shortness. i love the top, it's very pretty detailing, cute, just as pictured. i ordered a size 2 and it fits great. i usually wear petites, but you really don't need to get a petite because it's short as it is. i have broad sho",4
"Love this jacket! the sleeves are a little big/loose but it's not quite as flattering as it could be, but it's so comfy it's worth it! great quality.",4
"This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.",0
"Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online, but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!",4
"The shirt is a heavier weight than how it looks on the product page which was a nice surprise. it has a boxy shape and was shorter than expected. i'm 5'7"" and the front of the shirt above the hips. the design and color is great. very happy overall.",4
I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.,2
"Love! adds texture and femininity to a basic sweater. ordered a small so i could layer. if you're busty or between a s and m, you may want to size up.",4
"After reading the reviews, i decided to order this top. i was so pleased, and when i wore it for the first time, i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.",4
The dress is too loose and runs too big,1
I'm anxious to wear this dress with boots. i love the colors and print. perfect for work and evenings out.,4
"This is a great little top. a wonderful basic, but the crochet/lace detail adds the perfect amount of uniqueness. it's a soft jersey material that doesn't cling. falls very nicely over the body, flow-y without being too flow-y. i ordered my usual small, and it fits tts. for reference i'm 5'1, 125 lbs, and 34d bust. i did not order the petite since i have a longer torso, very happy i orderer a regular small. will be a great spring and summer top.",4
"I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.",1
This had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me.  it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy.,1
"I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace, for the weekend. i am 137 lbs, a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly.",4
"Love! love! love! this top! i saw this online and immediately knew tha tthis had to be in my wardrobe. i wear a lot of navy....(in my estimating the classiest color there is...black is passe'). it is simple, very wearable with pants, with skirts. the very thin stripe adds interest, without really being a pattern that conflicts with other patterns. i did have an issue with some threads that were randomly hanging from sleeve cuff...but nothing important. yes, it is cropped...very much so!!! so, if",4
"I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side, but on my 5'7"" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!",2
"Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink, a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large, depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas, it is",4
"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.",1
"This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it",2
"It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan, but this dress just wasn't for me.",1
"Pretty blues! colors are exactly as pictured! fits perfectly; not boxy, not tight, just comfortable! i'm 5'9 and this is tunic length on me!",4
Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!,4
"Good quality jeans, but had to return, as they did not fit my curvy hips.",3
"When i tried these on in the store in my size, but thought they felt tight, but the person helping me pointed out that they hug you, but are not uncomfortable. i uncuff the bottom and wear them full-length. ended up buying one of each color.",3
"Fits true to size. good quality, style and length.",3
"Tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didn't fit me right. it'a great romper, cute design, super soft-light fabric and overall a great feel but it doesn't work to well for short girls with any types of hips. i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering. i couldn't get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist, instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs. sizing up didn't help becaus",3
"I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty, and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately, the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big, and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well, so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung, which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded",1
I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.,3
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and was so bummed to see it on backorder online until may! i went to my local store and they had it in stock so i immediately tried it on. i'm not usually a big fan of maxi dresses but this dress is so pretty and the quality is amazing! the fabric is light and airy but not too delicate and the subtle beading on the top adds an extra special touch. the waist is a little high (it's similar to the picture online) but i'm also 5'10 so it mi,4
These leggings are perfect!! i normally struggle to find pants that are comfortable and flattering but these are exactly what i've been looking for. they are so versatile - they can be worn for a lazy day in or a night on the town. a new staple in my wardrobe!,4
"Love, love, love this dress! the color is a beautiful blue grey, and the peach embroidery has just a tiny bit of sparkle. can be dressed up or down.",4
"I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.",4
"Currently wearing right now :)
purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l, and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath, as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.
a must at the tag sale price!",4
"All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured, not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.",4
"I got this in blush pink and the details are very pretty. the dress is wide, might have a tailor bring it in on the sides, but its very comfortable and i like that it covers my arms a bit, but still keeps you cool.",3
"I like the pattern on this shirt and the fit over all is pretty good. i wasn't sure if i liked the sleeves as they are very angled, much more so than i expected. still, the shirt is nice enough that i'm keeping it.",3
"Beautiful! caught my eye online. i had to order then reorder in a smaller size, but it is wonderful. colors are beautiful.",4
"I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it!",3
"I was so excited to order this dress; however, once it arrived, i realized that the fit doesn't work for me. i carry my weight in my stomach and backside, and the dress clung to my trouble areas.",3
"Perfect for the change in weather, this sweater is very thick and a tad big. i would say it is true to size, but if you're like me and usually order up in sweaters and outerwear, don't. there is ample room for layering underneath without being too cumbersome. the color is a bit different than that shown; it is more of a blush heather with light gray threads intertwined. just a note, the pin does not come with the sweater; the closeup made me think it did, but it really doesn't matter. the color",4
"I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h",1
"Love the pattern & fabric. it does run a little large. i usually take a medium or large but with this dress, i may have even taken a small. it is somewhat drapey, which i like, but that needs to be considered when sizing for it. i'm hoping it shrinks a tad so the dress has a bit more shape. i'd exchange it, but i love the pattern & quirky sleeves so much i want to keep it! got this gem on sale & can't wait to wear it in the spring & summer months next year (or maybe on a warm vacation)...",3
"I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern, but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer, but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o",4
"These pants are made of a beautiful fabric that really brings out the rich color. like others have said they fit almost like high-waisted leggings, which i for one love. it makes them really comfortable while the nice, heavy fabric and lovely tailoring make it appropriate for an office. i do find that the pockets are pretty useless, as having anything in them ruins the lines of the trousers. the zipper is a bit pokey as well.",3
"I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials, which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet, business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though, so into rotation it goes.",2
I got the off-white lace top and love it! quality is great for the price. comfortable and the lace isn't super delicate so it seems like it should last.,4
"Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out
after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more
dressy than a regular legging.",4
"Very comfortable and soft. i wish the neck was a bit lower and it runs on the large side. i am 5'7"" wear a 10/12, i ordered the l and it was very big on me, will try it in the m, though i'm worried that it will be too high in the waist on me.",3
"Ok, so this is true to size-- i recently had a baby (i gained a lot of weight), am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online. i am 5'3 with a long torso, short legs, and a big fat butt so buying pants (especially rompers) are almost impossible. lengthwise, this fits me like pants. the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud. i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit. i don't think i've ever been so happy with an retailer pu",4
"I purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt. it's chic, versatile, and soft, a great rendition of a wardrobe classic.",4
"The colors on these leggings are just beautiful!  the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it.  no issues with see thru material.  i am 5'8"", 145, and i ordered my usual medium.",4
"I bought this top in the black with the dobby 4"" shorts in grey and wore them as a set 2 of the 3 days last weekend.
mind you, i am tall, but the neckline is lovely, the smocking creates a nice close drape, and the length and the fullness in the bottom, perfectly offset the short-short concept. got lots of compliments with the 2. 
i generally wear a 12 and ordered a medium which was fit nicely with enough room for a wash and dry going forward",4
"The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.
i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit, so if you prefer something more form fitting, you might opt for a smaller size.",4
"The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.",1
"Nice modern print, vibrant colors, and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!)",4
"I bought this in the white in both the sp and the mp. i am 5'2"". i ended up keeping the mp (my usually size at 36c, broad shoulders). i found that the top of the sleeves to be a bit snug and i have normal size arms. if you look at the model shots, you can see that they are tight on top. i also found this shirt to be very long, even in the petite sizing. overall, i kept it as it was slimming, quality made, and the tight sleeve hopefully won't bother me (or shrink!)",3
"Super thick material and it's lined with cotton so as not to be scratchy on the skin. it looks cute on, hopefully it will soften over time. almost thick like upholstery fabric.",3
"I thought this dress was very cute on the model, however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also, fabric wasn't great.",2
All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.,4
I've been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting. i'm between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and it's just a little roomy so it's perfect. fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it won't be too warm.,4
Great tank top! loved it so much that i ordered 3!,4
"This dress got my attention in the store due to the bright color. it's like a tangerine orange that absolutely shouts summer. loved the asymmetrical hem and another plus was the pockets! they look completely hidden so the dress does fall flat. i thought this ran a little big in the chest area, which doesn't happen often. a size 8 worked for me, can't wait to wear this!",4
"I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.",4
"Pants were super comfortable. a little too large. and the fabric was a little too heavy. i sent them back, and i'm regretting it now that they're completely unavailable.",3
"I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however, it didn't matter, because everything was itchy, and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design, and just like other reviewers commented, you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which, inevitably, will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning, there's no argument about that, and i welcome",4
"I just bought this at the store. i simply couldn't resist! it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down, sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city, strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event, slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening. can't wait to rock it. in terms of sizing, i am 5'5 150 with 36dd bust and some hips and booty. usually i am a size 6-8/m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style, i ended up",4
"Purchased these recently and loved the fit and feel upon trying them on. i was hoping that unlike linen pants, they'd keep their shape. no such luck. after an hour or two in them they were hanging and sagging. this is after being a (good) snug fit. i purchased my usual size and i'd say they stretched at least a size or two bigger. the color and feel of these is very nice and i see them being perfect for a very casual or slightly dressier outfit so i do recommend them. however, buy them small bec",3
"As previously mentioned, this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly, and the small was the right size for my frame, but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped, and i found the shoulders to be large, the neck a bit too high, and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4"", 140-ish, and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller, it could've worked. i so wanted to love this, because it's soft and comfortable and cute, but back it goes.",2
"I purchased this top (i thought of it as a sweater) to wear for a chilly holiday in mn. it's super flattering and i think it would be on anyone! my 28 year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another. we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable. i haven't seen how it cleans, yet. we both got the lighter colored one...love!",4
"This romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person.  however, i found it to run extremely short in the torso.  i couldn't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment.  for reference i'm 5'9 with a slightly longer than average torso.  i ordered my normal size m.",2
Top is well made. runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra. go a size smaller than your normal size.,2
"I love the green pattern. the fabric hangs and moves beautifully. thick enough to cover undergarments without slip or liner. ballet back is nice detail. i'm curvy and generally between s and m, s has a little room to spare. generally flattering piece. great for summer!",3
I ordered a small. i'm usually a petite small. i like my tees not fitted. i will exchange it for an xs. soft. it has like the look of a seam down the middle of the back. i barely noticed it. i think it makes a plain tee shirt a little unique. good quality. 100 percent cotton. it's a white tee. soft.,4
"Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!",4
"I really liked this dress when i tried the navy on in the store. i am 5'4"", 140 lb. and the medium fit me really well. unfortunately, i am not comfortable showing a lot of leg so the dress was just too short for me. if it had come to the tops of my knees i would have gone for it but it was well above my knees. the fit and color were great though, i loved the neckline and the material was very soft and comfortable. i tried the large but, while it was a little longer, the larger size made it lose",3
I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made. (wrong color?) fyi: 102 lbs. 32c,4
Love this top! the length is perfect and it is very stylish! hope it will come in other colors because i would buy more!!,4
I love wearing sweaters when it gets cooler out but hate the bulkiness that comes with them. this is a super cute sweater that isn't too bulky and gives you the sexiness you're looking for! great material.,4
"I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos, and have purchased many pairs. however, the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved, although they have the exact same name. they are now ""boy cut"", and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say ""boy cut"". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri",1
"This t-shirt is great! it fits really well and is very flattering. the colors are nice, including the t-shirt color itself. the fit is perfect, including the sleeves. and it's very comfortable. my only concern is how well it will do after you wash it a few times.",4
"I love rifle paper, and when i saw this dress online, i knew that i had to have it. this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture. it's pretty and delicate, and can easily be dressed up or down. i found this dress to fit true to size. it definitely has that ""baby doll dress"" fit to it, but i love it! this is a dress that i'll feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again.",4
"I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake, but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress, but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough, the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad, as the print is lovely.",2
Love it! perfect casual look with a jacket and booties,3
These are a comfortable and fashionable pair of shorts!  they run true to size and look great!,4
"I love all of these dresses, ordered the ivory in 00p on accident, meant to order 0p. was too small, but 0p would have fit. it is flattering, the pattern of lace is great, but i didn't like the color as much in person. i think i would like the blue better.",3
"I love it!!! i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch with
friends!",4
"This dress looked very flattering on me, i say true to size to slightly small. as mentioned in title, the zipper ended up opening in the middle near where the waist is. the lace is soft and fits comfortably, the waist band is the tighter fit. the skirt is less see-through in the store anyway. darker red in person (overall). hoping the one i tired on was a fluke. the skirt has a bit of pleating to it, or atl east it looks like it...

"This is my first one piece bathing suit, and i absolutely love it. the quality is great ! the color doesn't fade.
i usually wear a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 and it fits perfectly.",4
"I was returning something to the store. before i stepped out of the store when this skirt caught my eyes. it's such a nice skirt, with the gorgeous red color, beautiful buttons and material that is heavy and thick but soft. i paired it with a white shirt that is currently on sale and fell in love with both matching together. it is tts, i'm 5'5 and 120lb and i usually get 0-2 in size. size 0 was sold out in the store so i tried size 2 and it fits me very well. the length is great, it falls 2-3 in",4
"Great style and the color, can be dressed up or down. i love it!",4
Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy,2
"I love both the color of this sweater as well as the buttons on the cuffs. this sweater is an easy pick any day of the week and goes well with all of my work pants. plus, the soft and pretty pink adds some brightness to my otherwise dark winter wardrobe.",4
"I love this sweater!! love the length, it's a bit loose and delicate compared to what i usually wear, but looks great with boots and leggings. love the sheer fabric across the bottom of the back, the loose bows on the sides and the drape of the fabric. all combine to make a great sweater. runs true to size, has a loose fit but you don't feel like you are drowning in fabric like some loose fitting cardigans.",4
"Ag jeans are the only brand that fit my body type. for reference, i'm 5'4"", short-waisted with larger athletic thighs, smaller waist, bigger behind (or pear-shaped) and shorter legs. this is first time i didn't have to cut off several inches in length, though i may need to hem a few inches as these jeans hit right below ankle (not above like model photo). i usually wear a 29 in ag, but went up one size based on other reviewers comments. ag jeans are worth the price: great quality and made in the",4

"I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn't give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need",4
This top is so soft i want to wear it every day. the orange is beautiful in person. great fall color. perfect amount of swing.,4
"These jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for, but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected. i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models, but these were very long. i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans, but these did not fit the same as their other styles. they are good quality and would probably f",2
"I bought both the small and the medium and seem to be right in between. the small is a tad tight through the shoulders and arms, but the medium feels a bit baggy. it is soft and hangs nicely - i just need to figure out if i will wear it enough to justify the price.",3
They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.,4
"I already have this in white. i wear it all the time and get tons of compliments because it's so unusual. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because my white one is a large petite and this one was not available in petite (i bought a m). i'm 5'2"", 135lbs and am a little thick in the middle so the large petite gave me that extra room. this material is stretchy though so i am able to kind of pull on the sides to widen it a bit. i put it in the dryer and it shrunk a little in length too. th",3
"This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress, even with the slip, which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip, wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea",2
"These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly, i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer, and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size, they are adorable!",4
"Gosh, this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing, but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details, fit is comfortable yet elegant, nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath, but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).",4
"Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.",4

"These pants are much cuter on than in the picture. i love the fit, snug legs and normal waist. will order again in another color.",4
"This dress is incredibly soft! with sleeves that can be rolled up or down, it is extremely versatile. while the dress is very comfortable and mostly fits true to size, i found it to be ever so slightly snug through the hips at first. however, i am somewhat difficult to fit with an accentuated hourglass figure. overall, i am very happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing it during my travels!",4
I bought this in black and the checkered pattern. love both. very floaty and feminine. fits true to size.,4
"Great, comfortable tank. cool added detail in the straps. runs big so size down. i wear both a medium and large at retailer and got this in a small.",4
"I tried these on to compare with a different style and didn't like this one a much (also ag brand). these fit better at the waist, but seemed long on me and made me look frump ear. i think they are really comfortable, adn on the longer legs would be great. buy f you are taller than 5 foot 1.5 inches:-).

"More of a blouse than a tee because of the fabric which has a linen feel to it, on the front, the back of the top is more of a tee shirt material. not a travel top as it would wrinkle. the pattern and colors are the same as pictured. the sizing is large - i ordered an xs; my size is usually a small. it is a generous fit and boxy, not shaped at all. the back has a horizontal stitch band about half way down which provides a loose blouson effect.the back (which is all black and is tee shirt fabric)",4
Beautiful shirt. the color is more navy than pictured. the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture. my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem.,3
I'm so in love with these pants. they are so flattering and made of thick material. they do run a bit large though so i'd suggest you size down. i also like they they're high waisted. the gold button details are gorgeous as well. great pair of pants.,4
"I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes, the length (at the knee, 5'5"") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70's but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall, i love it!",4
"This jacket is soft, a beautiful color, the perfect length, and incredibly versatile (a fleece jacket that doubles as a blazer) but i was swimming in it! i wouldn't have minded the larger size, but the sleeves looked ridiculous. i wish i'd ordered early enough to try a petite size, but i'm not sure that would've helped. sad to send this back!",3
"This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt, it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy, marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer, requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way, unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally, the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh",1
"I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back.",2

I love this shirt. i bought the ivory color. it's incredibly comfortable and an easy style.,4

"Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8"" and around 135 and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit.",4
I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.,4
I ordered this in size xl and it is a perfect top. the draping is very flattering to my shape. the material is soft and the flowers/colors are appropriate for work. it's the perfect length too. i love everything about the cut of this top. the pattern will vary on each since the flowers are staggered. i love the knot effect along the waist. great purchase. hope this style will continue to be used for other tops in other patterns/colors for spring/summer timeframe. these are a little too dark/heav,4
I wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt (also sold at retailer) that hits above knee and received so many compliments. the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous. i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it. not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist. sleeves hit above wrist as well.,4
This is longer than i thought it would be- but again i'm petite! i ordered the grey and it's more of a grey green color that is absolutely beautiful. it is such a cute and easy top to wear!,4
"After reading every review, i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust, and i'm small busted. i can't stand wearing camis, so there no way i'd be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference, i'm 5'6"", a straight build 134 lbs, and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are, i loved the green color and length of sk",1
"I bought my typical size (xs) and it fits perfectly. it's loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for. the material seems very durable. my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt. the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion. i've only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans, booties, simple earrings and a statement necklace. i highly recommend it.",4
"I probably wouldn't have even tried this on in the store, but i took a chance when it was on sale. i put it on and it was immediate love. the fit is perfect. i am between a medium and a large and got it in a large. it is not boxy, but not too tight either. it feels well made.",4
"Bought this tank on a whim, but i'm so happy i did! so flattering, comfy and well made.",4
"Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.",2
"Bought the aqua because sizes were sold out. the bright color will be a welcome change this winter among all my neutrals. it's lovely, soft, well-fitting, and i only hope we have a few days in the south so i can wear it. well worth the price. would be a lovely wardrobe addition for any age, changed by what it's worn with...shoes, accessories,",4
Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything . i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine( i like it tied). this will stay in my closet all year round . it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesn't bother me . a must buy !,4
This top is really comfortable but dressy enough for a business/casual office. the fit is nice and loose without making you look larger than you are. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear this.,4
This dress is so easy to wear! the neck line is not too low! can wear a regular bra!! it flows beautifully! i love it!!,4
But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall.,3
"I have a gala to attend next weekend and can't wait to wear this beautiful cape. i'm a big fan of nanette lepore
clothing and this cape does not disappoint. it is absolutely beautiful....chic and elegant.",4
"These pants are amazing and great quality! thank you to the reviewers who suggested sizing up one size. the trousers don't have a lot of stretch and are very cute and well-made and the size up is perfect! i am normally a 2r in most pants and skirts and i sized up to a 4r, they are perfect. gorgeous pattern, and i too, am not a ""pattern""-type. will go perfectly with a number of the solid, flowy maeve tops i have for work.",4
"Darling top, lovely dark rich raspberry red color. runs very large so definitely size down. i ordered the s and m. i am usually m but went with the small. the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly- it was only an issue when i hugged myself. in the picture it looks like it fits her very well. i don't feel like it fits me quite as well- it's borderline maternity-ish... just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more. i agree the bow i.e. seems weak (fa",3
"This is absolutely a 1-season top. the material is very thin and flowy, with the front v plunging pretty dramatically. i'm using mine as a swim cover, and i'm thrilled to report the mottled pattern on the cotton hides perspiration(!)
the first time i wore this top, i paired it with denim shorts, and the hemline completely covered the shorts, so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover, i'd just go with yoga shorts benea",3
"I had high hopes for this top. really boxy, short",2
"I have been on the search for a perfect lbd for years and have wasted money on dresses that i had to settle for but when i saw this dress i knew it was love at first sight!!! the things i love about this dress: the built in shaper/slip holds your junk in place, the lace detailing is perfect in all the right places, and the button and hook & eye makes you feel secure. great dress that you will love!!",3
I was a little skeptical about this one at first. i have a hard time with the over all styling of many maxi dresses. i liked the print and figured i would give this a whirl. it is beautiful! looks great on and i love the fabric!! so happy i picked this one up.,4
I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.,4
"The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.",0
"I love this dress! good for work or social occasions. flowy fabric, and not boxy. the length is perfect, not too short.  i can't wait to wear it. picture is accurate as to color.",4
"I didn't pay much attention to this shirt on the website...when i was in the store yesterday though, i grabbed the green color because it's so pretty! i went back home to see which shirt this was on the website and was surprised. the picture here really doesn't do it justice. it's very soft, has a beautiful and flattering necklace and the flutter sleeves hang nicely rather than puffing out (like snow white...which isn't my goal!). also, because the sleeves drape nicely, you could wear it under s",4
"This is a very pretty summer top. the detailing at the neckline adds interest, and the floral pattern is gorgeous! one note: in the picture, the top appears to have a white background, but it is actually more of an ivory/cream color. this is definitely a swing top style with a lot of room in the body. i am 5' 8"", 145, and normally wear a medium or 6 in retailer tops. i ordered a small in this top, and it fit great at the top but was almost too large in the body of the top. i am considering",4
"I think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured. i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean, but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed. the color is slightly brighter than the picture, which is fine, though i was digging the slightly greyed look.

anyway, these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else. i have a fairly athletic build, so it's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs,",2
I love this top. the quality is topnotch and it's true to size. it's not skintight but it's also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that it's a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!,4
"I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short, and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.",2
I wanted to love this but my hips interfered. it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure. beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right. sadly it was returned!,4
This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.,0
"I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3"") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase.",4
Very cute but a little short. currently pregnant so i'm hoping it will hang better in a few months,3
I saw this trench in an email a couple weeks back and instantly fell in love. i bought it for myself for my birthday and got it just the other day and it is just as beautiful in person as it is online. fits true to size and is so flattering. i love the true navy color and cannot wait to wear this on cool spring nights!!,4
"This is a great dress, both in design and comfort. the material is very soft and warm. yet it is also very stylish, and can be dressed up with big necklaces, a belt, and boots. the stylist in the store mentioned wearing it with a vest. it is a great piece that has so many possibilities. i bought it in navy. thank you retailer!!",4
"The design on the blue sweater is actually a dark navy (not black, as i thought it was), but it still looks beautiful with black underneath. rather than jeans like it's shown, the v-neck is a nice change from other cardigans i have - looks great with a cami or another v-neck underneath it. soft, nice medium-weight and not at all itchy. happy with this as an easy everyday sweater.",4
"I really love this dress but i am still struggling with keeping it or not. i have an hour glass figure with a somewhat fullish behind :). it is tight around that area which i think it is meant to be but i am not sure how comfortable i am with that. i wasn't sure about the belt but it really works. i am 5""3 and weigh 118. i did have to size up from 2p to 4 p for it not to feel too tight in all areas.",3
"I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also, i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.",2
"I bought this jacket in the grey blue color and i absolutely love it. it is warm an sophisticated and versatile. i am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and the medium was good for me.",4
"I'm in love with this skirt! i already have so many outfits planned out! i do feel it runs slight large, maybe half a size?? i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and usually wear a 6. i ordered a small, and it's fairly loose, but i like that personally. if you want a tighter pencil look, then size down.",4
"Great material, pattern and cut. perfect summer top",4
"Pretty color, flattering fit. the flesh-baring lace inset in the middle required me to wear a tank.",3
Loved this top! bought it during the recent promo and thought the sale price more fair. i sized up because i wanted a swing-ier silhouette and more room at the neckline. the top is impeccably made and the embroidery is sturdy. i did not find the top see-thru and am wearing it with a racer back black bra and have no issues.,3
Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.,4
"I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model, but if i was to tighten it, it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite), and it looked huge, when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work, it was a lot of fabric, and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall, so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look, this is great. i would, however, order eptite for 5'1.5"". (115 lbs, 03 dd che",3
"I tried yellow motif, but unfortunately, i did not purchase it.
it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me...
i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves.
texture was ok.
usually, i like a cool touch of linen.
but this t-shirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen.
i was not quite sure; it just was not right for me.
only word i could think was ""average.""
personally, i do not recommend it, but who knows, maybe it is right for you...
so, try wear",2
This dress is a great casual outfit. tha fabric is substantial and very soft. the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms. i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium. sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it!,3
Great top that can be worn so many ways. i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person. it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture. i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types.,4
"It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???",0
"I loved the design of this suit when i saw it online.
 the material is definitely high quality and the bottoms i knew would stay put, if they had fit me in the first place. i ordered a size medium in both top and bottom. the bottoms were much much too small and the top was just ever so slightly too large. i should've known something was up with sizing because all of the larges were sold out already. i think i could've used a large bottom and a size small top.",3
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and due to the ""slim fit,"" i ordered a size up -- a 2 petite up from my normal 0 petite. when i received it, i was surprised about two things: 1) the material was kind of puffy (not bad, just weird), and 2) it was too big on top - rare for a petite size - even though it fit everywhere else. i wanted to love it, but had to return. would be gorgeous for someone else!",2
I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.,2
"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!",4
"Love this tank, i am petite and this was the perfect length for me, i wore it with white jeans and a blazer.  love the print!",4
"Soft fabric. great color for fall and sophisticated detail at waist, sleeves. a keeper!",3
Great color fit was very true to size,4
"I just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small, i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly. i'm a petite yet busty 34d-27-35 and 5'4"" and think the dress looks adorable on especially since i'm a huge fan of all things plaid. it's a lighter weight dress so it's perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fall/winter with this color scheme by adding tights, boots and a sweater or jacket. i also love that it has pockets. i don't",4
"I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits, but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it, but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit, i will be returning this dress.",2
I purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation. it's such a cute fun print. i purchased my regular size xs and it's a good fit. the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it. got it during the 25 percent promo ..,3
"I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a ""flowy"" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor",4
"Great little shift dress! for me it seemed to run true to size. i'm 5' 4.5"" and curvy. the regular size 10 fit perfect, about 3"" above the knee. a really fun design with the fringe. can't wait to wear once the snow is completely gone.",4
This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.,4
This shirt fits great. normally wear an xs or a small and a small fits in this. comfortable and cute on. i wish i had ordered the other color as well.,3
"As others have said, this is cropped, so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable, so i don't want to have to send it back.",1
"I was really excited to receive this dress. it's a fun concept and different from anything else i have. however, the dress was way too short on me. i'm 5 ft 6 in., and the size medium was way too short. given the thin nature of the material, i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress, even for wearing it outside the office. i will have to return this dress.",2
"I ordered two pairs of the red cords, one my typical size, one a size smaller in case i found that the pants stretched out. they run true to size and have a nice fit with a high(er) rise waist. the color is beautiful. i did not find that the pants stretched out but they do seem to bunch somewhat which may come from the thickness of the material.",3
"Love these jeans! they fit great, they feel great. i am 5'9.5 135 pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair.",4
"I am normally a size m, sometimes a small. i ordered a small based on the reviews and it was so huge i could have been six months pregnant and it would still fit. i would need to size down to an xxs, but at this point i'm returning it....gorgeous colors. i wish it fit :(",3
"I originally bought the white lace version of this dress, but it felt too ""bridey?"" then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version. i like that it is not all lace, with the pleated chiffon ""center."" the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow. it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps. well worth the price as this will f",4
I'm so glad i tried this dress on to see how lovely it is. definitely a keeper!,4

"I love skorts! so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size 6. arrived today & really cute. fit is good w/ some room to spare. almost too big but i'll stick w/ the 6. looks as in the pic except the lower front part & the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric. not shown in the pic though. it's understated but attractive. the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness. casual or a little dressy, just love... 5'3"", 117#.",4
"I like this sweater but i'm not in love. the rib knit on the sleeves are too form fitting (not restrictive) on my chubby arms so it doesn't look flattering when i wear long sleeves. i do appreciate the mixed patterns and the soft moss colorway, it's very pretty together. i purchased the medium petite and the length looks good. maybe i need the large because of my body type. i'll give it another chance when my paquerette gets here",3
"These are fantastic, great fit, super comfortable material and perfect length (petite). i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair, but i also want the other colors! 0p fit 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs. length on petite is enough to have a small heel) i have short legs).",4
Love this vintage high waisted bikini bottom! fits true to size. it pulls up to a little past my belly button and the runching is in all the right places. i'm not too sure how it will stay put in the waist area for a dip in the ocean . can't wait to lounge around in it ar the beach though.,4
"I love all jeans by mother, they are well made, fit great and look so cute with any type of shoes from heels, to flat to boots. these jeans are perfect to wear out or when paired with a blazer can be worn to work. i love these and have them in almost every color.",4
Lovely dress!  i&amp;amp;#39;m wearing it with a blue denim jacket and brown suede boots.  it is most certainly purple - a little more so than the picture.  still love it.,4
"This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric, detailed embroidery, and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy, yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.",4
I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.,2
"I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans, as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans, they fit very well. however, for the price, they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose, even after 20 wears",2
"I have been dreaming of the perfect overall that i can live in this spring/summer. these overalls completely fit the bill. i would normally wear a size 24, but i wanted the fit to be more relaxed with a slight slouchy look. i went with a a size 25 and they are exactly what i wanted. i feel like i can move around feely in these. they are extremely comfortable and the denim is pretty lightweight. i highly recommend these!",4
I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.,2
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.,4
I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.,2
"Soft and feminine, pretty pastel colors, very romantic. the fit is flattering and feminine, the fabric is light, the lining is soft. color is pale and i may need a little brighter colors, but i might let that pass... i am on the fence only based on color, otherwise, gorgeous dress. the 0 fit me well, but the back touched the ground, so i would probably order petite (front is higher, so no issue there).

"Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 115 lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you",3
"Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5"",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! .",4

"I ordered this top in xsp and xs. i don't think i let the xsp top breathe long enough, because i thought it was too short and sent it back.

"I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top. 
the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off. 
i felt that it flowed perfectly, not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)

Love this cardigan! it is a really a sweet and sexy top. so flattering to curves and yet conceals too. the material is wonderfully soft and stretchy.,4

I wear cardigans pretty much every day since my office is chilly and i need something a little dressier to be able to wear that will keep me warm. i love the design of this cardigan which makes it very flattering-the longer in front is a style i gravitate toward and i like that the back isn't just straight but it has that little flair-this is not something that is commonly seen in a cardigan (unless it is short all the way around) and it was great attention to detail by the designer. i like the,4

"Comfortable and flows well, does run large, order one size smaller.",4
This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love,2

"I like the cut and look of this shirt, and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs, 30ss chest), but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun, and the color is adorable, but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.",3
"This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover",4
"This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.",2
"I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .",4
"This dress is truly a work of art, and i've received many compliments on it. 

be warned, though, that it may require extensive tailoring to fit you. i'm 37-28-40 (so pretty darn hourglass shaped) and 5 feet 3 inches. i ordered the 8p. the dress was still huge in the the waist and not flattering at all. the neckline, also, was too low for my comfort. (if you're busty, necklines get pushed out and more things show.) my tailor was able to bring the neckline up by adding seams in the sleeves and",3
"I tried on this skirt in stores and loved it. the only thing is, i'm usually a 2 or a 26 and had to buy a 6. for reference, i'm 5' 7 and about 120 pounds. if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in, i'd recommend you go up a size as well!",4
"I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. there's a lot of material so it's flowy. but, it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully, unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut, make my shoulders & arms look huge. i don't have the shape to pull this off. but, for wearing at home in the summer, they're worth having. the m",2
"It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water, line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water",2
"The cut of this shirt is lovely and well thought out, the opening for the arm are not too big like some other shirts. i liked the material and the melon/ salmon color which i ordered was more vibrant in person. this does run large so i wished i had ordered one size down.",3
I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i'm assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that's why i don't need a cami underneath.,3
"Adorable! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit. i'm sure i'll wear this with jeans, as pictured, but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt.",4
"I finally was able to order the xs petite (my typical size), adn received it. i had previously tried on the xs regular, but that was too much fabric. (i am 5 foot 1.5 inches, adn 115 lbs)

so the petite fit, but i still felt like the swing was a lot of fabric for me. classic cut, snug on the chest,so i wouldn't be able to wear a sweater underneath. overal, i did like,but decided to returrn it",3
"I finally ordered this after looking at it many times, had to order the 00p as they were out of all other petite sizes, and to my surprise, it totally fits me! why i put larger. both colors are equally nice, but due to my pale skin (and only petite available) i ordered the ""yellow"" one (brighter colors). cut is flattering, love the pleat detail in the skirt, the 00p fit my 30dd chest, and 26.5 inch waist. the length is perfect, above the knee in front and lower in the back. good choice...",4
"I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket. the color is not rose but the picture is accurate. it is more terra cotta as previous reviewer's said. it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots. i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist. i think it looks better buttoned, but i do wear it open as well.",4
"I bought this top in my usual size large and it is slightly big, but not so much that i would want to size down.  the material is slightly itchy, but i think that it's worth it because it's such a pretty top. i absolutely love the detail at the top.  it is beautiful!  if you wear a nude bra, you can't see the strap lines through the material.  i also love the coloring of this top.  this is a great top that i can see myself wearing with dress pants for work or with jeans for a more casual look.",4
Seafolly is my favorite swim/beach brand. the quality is always great! this is a colorful sheer kaftan that will get much use this summer.,3
It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.,2
"I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot, it had a flattering fit on me, extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1"" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct",2
I just bought these jeans and i absolutely love them. they are my new favorites. i like them so much i am buying another pair. i am short but always wear heels and these are perfect in every way. slimming as well.,4
"This top seemed so unique online, but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full, shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice,quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..",1
"Lovely fabric, color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can't even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don't buy sewing or ironing).  
disappointed.",2
"So comfortable! i wore it during my last airline travel day, and a complete stranger complimented me on it.",4
"Beautiful in white, and beautiful to look at, but as the other reviewer mentioned, the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however, the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition, some of the beading is already coming off, and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad, but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful",3
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.,2
Cute and great fitting pant. love the pattern and it fit tts for the brand. i normally wear a 10/12 and i took at 12. flattering.,4
"Based on the first person's review, i ordered a l at first... then i got it and it kinda fit like a maternity shirt and looked a bit too baggy/sloppy, not as flattering as the picture. i tried using the measurement guide below, based on the bust measurement, and i'm at the low end of the m size, so i ended up ordering the m and s just in case. the s size fit like the picture. i'm glad this isn't slim in the waist and fitted nicely in the shoulders. the blue color is beautiful. if you are more of",4
"I love this dress. i was afraid it would be too long because it said petite was 56"" but it was perfect. i am 5'0 and ordered the size xsp and the length is perfect. however, in the picture the lining is shorter than the outer layer, but on my dress the lining in longer than the dress in some areas. the dress is very modest in the front and the back has a nice plunge but not too low.",4
This dress looked nice online so i ordered it. once it arrived i tried it on and it looked even better. the fit was flattering as well. very versatile piece in an interesting print. glad i caught this piece on sale!,4
"I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much.",4
Love this shirt and the print. i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable. i've only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments. there are hints of neon in the coloring that can't really be seen in the pictures. i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldn't think of life without it.,4
"The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress. 
the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch, i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.

this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines",4
"These are some of the cutest jeans i've seen in a while. i ordered my usual size 28 and they were too big. i'm 5'9"" and about 140 lbs. i always were a 28! i reordered the 27, though, and they fit perfectly. the only disappointment was they make my butt look flat and emphasize my stomach, which isn't the case in other jeans. i think it's due to the high waist. they fit almost like a pair of pants. oh well, i'm keeping them. i tucked in a striped sailor tee and they looked adorable.",3
"These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6"" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle.",4
"These are the softest jeans ever! i love the way that they hold their shape, and make my bum look amazing!! i am 5'3"" and they do come much longer than shown on the model...right below my ankle bone. i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties! the fit is true to size...108 pounds and i got a 25. highly recommend!!",4
"I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price, it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again, not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.",3
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.,0
"I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide, short, and crooked. after it was washed once, it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.",0
Love love love this dress.  fits like a glove. beautiful details. amazing quality. i'm so happy with this dress and know i'll have it for years. :),4
"I was really pleased with this skirt. the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos. i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable, but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement. sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me, but this fit perfectly in my regularl size.",4
"I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look.",3
"I ordered this in the neutral motif and the colors and design are more beautiful in person. unfortunately, there were no ""petites"" available when i ordered so i will have to have the length and slit tailored.",3
"I purchased this online without seeing in person and was pleasantly surprised. i have purchased clothing made from netting with embroidered damask design in the past and found them to be stiff and scratchy, however, this is soft with some stretch that makes it very comfortable to wear. the fit in person is more form fitting than pictured and is quite flattering. another nice design element is while the shell appears to be see through, there is a built in strapless nude cami attached inside. over",3
"This is a very nice blouse. usually i am size 12-14, bought size l and it fits very well. would not size up. the fit is very forgiving (hides tummy); i like the v-neck. fabric does not look like polyester and of good quality. the blouse is versatile, looks good with skinny dark or white jeans. recommend!",3
"I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great, and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs, which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m, but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips, fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically, if you're deliberating between s and m for this top, get",2
"I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice, light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification, however, it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist, larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips, but does very little to show off my waist. overall, it is just ok.",2
"Love this shirt. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt.",4
"I actually like the fit - but i guess it depends on your overall body type. i too ordered a small and medium. i actually could fit the small, but preferred the room in the medium. the movement on these are spectacular and the material is light and cool.",4
"I wanted to love this dress, the open back, the lightweight fabric, and fun print. perfect for spring and summer. it could be i'm too tiny for this dress, but the front of the dress wasn't flattering. it just hung and there was an odd tuck in the waist that made it look like it ballooned out under my chest above my waist.",2
I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.,4
"These pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable. they are like cashmere for your legs...so amazingly soft!! and for that price, it's definitely worth getting all the colors!!",4
"This top is gorgeous in person! i got the small because at 5'5"", 127 pounds and a 30f chest, you never know how a top will fit. however, this one is big. i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out. i'll be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and there's a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse. love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it!",4
"This top is really pretty. i love the details on the back tail of the shirt. the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me. i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt. i would not iron that portion of the shirt either. overall, i am completely in love with this shirt. it will be a staple in my closet.",4
"I'm 7 months pregnant and bought this dress yesterday, it is perfect! the wrap design makes it possible to expand the skirt and still look cute. i'm 5'3"" bought the small and look forward to wearing this after i deliver as well.",4
"This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size, however, it's just not long enough on me to be a top, which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts, it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still",2
"I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror, it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however, that mayn't work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself, but at 48, i don't need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good!",2
This dress is very beautiful - great fabric and colors - but it looked terrible on me because i have large breasts. i am 32dd and this dress made me look pregnant. if you have the right body type it would be a great breezy summer dress. i'm sad because i can't wear it:(,2
"I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful, drab actual color.",2
"I finally visited a store with petite, and this dress was there, so of course, i snagged it to try on... i love the colors, i mean awesome, the fabric is also very soft, but the cut was just huh on me, nothing to go raving about,.,, i think it would be nice for a casual day but i often just wear joggers or yoga pants on casual days... so for the price i left it.",3
I purchased the poppy pocket tunic in yellow. the color is perfect and looks great with my dark grey leggings. cannot wait until it's cold enough to wear.,4
"This dress is more beautiful in person.
this dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders, chest(40c)and through my straight hips. note. the side bottom panels are very stretchy. i will have it tailored slimmer. so if you are bottom curvy, this dress is awesome!",4
I love the off the shoulder trend but don't like having to wear a strapless bra so this style caught my eye. it is cute and different and people compliment me on it. swingy but flattering and i got the turquoise but i like it so much i just ordered another one in the black and white stripe.,4
"Tried this dress on in a s and it fit very nicely.  it's a very unique dress and i loved it, but i just didn't know where i would wear it!",4
"The suit is beautiful, however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight, to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing, i ordered a medium, i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than ""full coverage"". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa",2
"These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.",0
"Unique and well-made skirt, sure to turn heads.  embroidery is lovely.  def a statement piece for any wardrobe.",4
"I ordered this for my mom in color ""blue motif"". i could not see a difference online between the colors ""brown motif"" and ""blue motif"" - both looked grey to me. in real life blue motif looks grey with a very light bluish tinge to it. it looks like grey wool and light grey-bluish fiber was interwoven, but you have to look very closely to see that. i guess i would have prefered a pure white or cream color but that is a matter ot your pesonal taste i guess. the cardigan style is an oversized one. t",3
Material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening.  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps @ bay. sure wish this came in blk. i bought mauve & just love it!,4
"This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.
i invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....
the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.
and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress, cocktail party or date night. the top de",2
"I had four weddings this fall and tried this dress on but ended up not purchasing because i already had dresses to wear. but, i told myself i would purchase the dress if it ever went on sale. i don't have an occasion to wear it yet but i can't wait! the dress is so lovely and the details are beautiful. the only thing i'm worried about is the possibility for some of the embroidered parts to pill. it looks very flattering and hugs all my curves beautifully.",4
Fit is perfect. body slimming. i'm glad i purchased it.,4
The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.,4
"I had been hearing about this dress for months and was so excited to see they brought it back in more colors. the reviews i read claimed it runs small in the chest area. i'm a true pear shape (23b, i normally wear - size 2, xs, on top and size 4-6 on the bottom, but with dresses i almost always get size 2) because of the swing a nature of the dress i decided to size down with this one. i was nervous how tight it would be up top but i also didn't want it to look like inwas wearing a sack! so i to",4
This was all wrong on me. the puffy sleeves made me look a foot wider. i'm thinking this will look good on tall slim ladies. it is extremely comfortable and the material is very pretty though. tts,4
"Definitely order down a size. i am almost always an xl (big chest, broad shoulders) but the l in this fits me perfectly. well worth the sale price, a fun boho transition piece!
it is a ""reverse print"" so the inside is brighter than the outside, but i like the blurred paisley print--it's subtle.

the back detail is great and very flattering.

it is quite full and flowy, but in a flattering way, i think. just restrained enough.",3
"My first review and first full price designer denim purchase....

i recently lost weight and in need to replace all my pants and in search of a dark wash high rise jeans (preferably in black), finally decided to buy this at full price online coz of all the fab reviews. i decided to purchase the 25p, thinking that i may return after receiving it in the mail since i wasn't able to try at the store and not sure if i got the right size, also it's not the high rise denim that i was looking for. but t",4

"I ordered this top in the grey along with the white lace up back pocket tee. while the other tee was totally see through and very poor quality, this one delivers in every way. in fact, i am sending the other one back to get this top in the ivory as well. the lace is very substantial and the fabric is not see through at all, like so many tops are these days. i ordered my usual medium and it comes down over my bum, just like i wanted to wear with leggings. i see this as a staple and this is my fir",4
"Based on the other reviews, i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p, but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.",1
I recently purchased this dress and am so happy with it. the gathered area over the bust is visually interesting and isn't too revealing. the jersey material hangs beautifully. i also appreciate it being lined.,4
"If the sweater looked as it does in the picture, i would keep it. however, it was very boxy and short, a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.",2

the price was very nice. 
i thought it said gray but what i got is more brown.",3
"These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!",1
"I liked the understated colors of this dress, so i decided to try it on. i did not expect it to fit so well! i'm 5'3"" with a large bust and large hips. the dress was super slimming and flattering, it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me. the only thing i'd have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long, but i'm used to that with my height. the straps are positioned perfectly, my bra straps didn't even show. the material is very thin and light.",4
"I really wanted this dress to be perfect, but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me, perhaps it works better on a taller frame.",1
"I have a hard time with skinny pants due to my muscular thighs... but these worked. the length on the petite was a tad long, but i see on the model hers do a similar thing so perhaps it is meant to be that way... would look better with heels for me (below 5'2"")",3
"I just saw this in the store and had to pick it up. i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of tops/dresses. i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it, paired with slim fitting black pants and boots.",4
I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.,2
"Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress. i have already a few events lining up for the summer months, and i could see this working on those hot summer days. i'm short and curvy so i tried on the large in store (i'm busty) and ended up ordering the petite l online. the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room. i love the 3/4 length, i feel a great length when you're only 5'1, will look great wi",4

Perfect! can't believe how inexpensive this is for the look. it looks just like it does on the model. i can't wait to wear it on my vacation.,4
"I bought these in the store today. they're a great jean. none of the pairs i saw had as much distressing as the picture. there were no holes, which i'm actually grateful for, i don't like holes in jeans. anyway these had a great fit for me. they fit more like a slim straight jean on my curvier figure and really flatter my backside- they aren't baggy, as pictured on the model. they're a great casual jean which i know will be my new staple! (even better- my husband gave them a big thumbs up!)",3
"Caught my eye because of the colorful graphic print, in my closet because of the super sale price.  it fits as expected in size medium, a little bit long since i'm short.  i'm unsure of the longevity since it's a viscose mix.  feels a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i don't really wear tank tops without layers so this is a great addition to my casual wardrobe.",3
"This is no exception to the rule! i love turtlenecks and this one is going to be a favorite. do know that this is not lightweight-even though this is sleeveless it is definitely a substantial knit. the color is a beautiful nutmeg and can be dressed up or down. i purchased a gorgeous neutral beaded necklace to go with it and it is simply stunning! it does 'bell out' a little at the bottom which, in my opinion-is the only design flaw. i normally wear a medium in most retailer tops and the small is a",4

"Love this top! the lace pattern is gorgeous, and the detail at the neck and sleeves make it a little more casual. it's completely sheer, so you do need a white tank or shell underneath. the top is on the shorter side, but definitely not a crop. i'm 34c and 140b and got a small. fits great and pairs well with black pants and heeled booties.",4
"I love this dress! splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself, and i'm so glad i did! it's such a comfortable dress - stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric. it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter, or on it's own with a statement necklace. style and fit are great - this dress is super flattering,",4
A great little dress that can be dressed up or down.,4
"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!",4
This dress was exactly what i wanted. great material. cute pale blue slip lining the dress. i ordered a medium and it was perfect. i am about 5'6 and about 145. i received compliments all day on how cute it was,4
"Love the look of this poncho - which is not as large/billowy as i thought it would be. i tried it on as a whim in the store and fell in love. the colors are more beige than gray, for those of you with pale/blue underdone complexions. it may wash you out. love the orange knit running through to give it a little pop. i'm 5'9""/132 pounds, and the hem was a bit cropped on me. may want to consider a tank top or t-shirt underneath.",4
"I love love love these white jeans. the crop style is great as i am 5'1"", so the fit is perfect for an ankle jean.
these fit the bill in every way. they are so comfy!",4
"I too, was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable.  the shorts part is lined which is nice.  not see through.  the waist is a smocking with elastic.  it's also very thin thread.  the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out.  i bought a different one knowing it was delicate.  this isn't a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of",2
"I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.",1
"I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i'd love to see more styling options for this top because i'm a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.",4
"I first saw this shirt online and decided to see it in person. so happy i did! i never would have picked it up in the store. it looks much better on than on the hanger. it is so flattering! you can wear it on or off the shoulders and although it is a boxy shirt, it somehow makes you look slim! wow! i took my usual medium. highly recommend!",4
"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.",4
Very nice and the sleeve have a great design and the length is finally long enough,4
"I really wanted to like this top. in fact, i have put it on to wear several times then opted for something else. so i'm thinking it has to go back. for one thing, the yoke part is sewn onto the bottom so the stripes are crooked...that bothers me. i may get it in the white instead because i do like the style. i just wish it were in a solid color. but try it - it might work for you!",2
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32 -40 and the medium fit me well.

2. my only problem is that the collar keeps falling to the back. i feel like the shoulder isn't cut right to sit on the shoulder. i seem to have this problem a lot with this brand, where the shirt just wants to fall to the back.",3
"Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric, but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer, but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother, otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.

now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge, i ordere",2
"I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me, they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.",2
"This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.",4
"This dress hits all of the high notes for me. it is crisp, elegant, and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create. i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe. it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering. wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy. it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime.",4
"I liked the idea of the scarf tie, so i tried on this top in the store. it was so cute on, that i ignored that it was a bit overpriced for the quality. the material is more of a t-shirt with elastic at the bottom, so it poofs a bit rather than laying flat. i'm not sure how durable the fabric is. it's still really flattering and the scarf color adds a bit of a pop to the navy color. i think ti would look great with jeans but, with the right pants, i could dress it up a bit and wear it to work. it",3
"I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving, being that they don't have much stretch.  they are always in the stack that i try on but haven't bought a pair of citizens in several years. these are totally different!  the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings.  i looooooove these jeans!!!",4
"I wanted to love this top, but had 2 major problems with it. first, it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt, which was terribly unflattering. second, the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.",2
"Absolutely beautiful dress. i bought a size 8 and found it tts. i typically buy 6/8 in retailer dresses. the print is gorgeous (i am a sucker for anything with poppies) and i love the silky material; hugs your curves and flows nicely. i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews, and because i am of short torso, but it fits well. would definitely recommend.",4
"I bought the s; came with a tag saying ""sz 8"". it is in fact more like a size 2, if not 0. 

the bust is probably a 34 a or b, or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well, but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it, so i will return it. 

the fabric, design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality.",2
"These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.

i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam.",4
"Love the lace back panel, unique design. would not call this blue....definitely more of a grey color, but it is pretty! got size small and it fit well. 5'6"" 140 lbs.",4
"First, i love wool. if it's 100% wool, i love it. if wool isn't your thing, then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3"". it is warm and cozy with pockets, which i love. with the sleeves being short, i am wearing a long, frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice, but runs large through the hips. however,",2
"Saw these in store and had to have them. online pictures do not do them justice. great pattern, fabric and features. can be dressed up or down. sizing is accurate--i am 5' 4"" and 117 lbs and bought an xs. they fit perfectly. wish they had more colors/patterns to purchase.",4
These leggings are awesome quality especially for the price. they are warm and form fitting. they are thick and the design is nice. i plan on wearing them all winter!,4
I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.,4
This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you can't see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt.,4
"The reason i purchased these pants is because i don't have anything like it. they are fun but nice enough to wear in the work place. well constructed, too. the only thing is they are very long. i am 5'4"" and these are probably 3-4 inches below what the picture shows. i had purchased a pair of platform shoes from retailer awhile back that will go perfect with these pants; however, i my still have to have them hemmed. other than that, they run pretty true to size. i usually wear a size 10 and the pa",3
"Lovely top, well made and feels wonderful on. attention petites - i highly suggest you go for petite sizing because the standard xs is ginormous and looked nothing like it does on the model pictured.",4
"This top is a nice color and soft material, but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it, but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.",2
This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint. it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine. i got the deep red color and it is beautiful. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my usual small and it fit tts.,4
"This top is beautiful and i have received so many compliments on it. the fit is very complimenting, and i would continue to wear it often except that the fabric is unraveling. the bottom of the lace has raw edges so i would expect some fraying there but my top is shedding long streaks of material with each wear throughout the entire top, 1-5"" strands of the lace unraveling isn't exactly a great look.",3
"This dress is absolutely flattering and will make you feel beautiful. fabric is thin but can easily be transitioned from fall to winter to spring. hugs all the right places. true to size. i am 5'2 and 120lbs, curvy and the small fit well. i am so happy with this purchase. great price point as well",4
Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!,4
As in super comfortable and a joy to wear. i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on. the moment i put it on i knew it was for me. i missed out on getting it in the other color. i hope you get more in other colors!,4
I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out,2
"The outer layer runs large up top; also, the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.",2
"I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.
it runs a little big, so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side, but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.",4
"I actually love the thickness of the cotton fabric on this top. i am tired of too thin shirts that develop holes right away. i love the color too.i am usually a medium and the medium fits well, if a little roomy.",4
I love this top it is easy to wear fun and very comfortable. i was thinking about it for weeks and kept coming back to it after i read a review about going up a size i decided to go for it and i am very happy i did!!! my new favorite!!!,4
"I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too, to see if they wanted it or liked it better, but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses,i just don't think is cut well.",1
"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...

i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on",4
I ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly. i love the longer length so that it can be worn with leggings. the detail is so pretty especially the colorful side panels.,4
This top was a great purchase even though it's a bit expensive. love the colors and the fit.,4
"My new favorite. i purchased the ivory in a medium, and the lilac in a large when it went on sale (medium was already sold out). i'm 5'7"" and about 125 pounds, 34c give or take. the medium fits great, and i found the large only slightly bigger, but it does not look too big. i usually wear a small or medium in most retailer sweaters.
as was previously noted, the back is cut higher than pictured. i actually like this, as it gives the sweater a unique look. i tend to layer with a button down for the",4
"Ordered this in the neutral motif, size large and it's a great little dress. comfortable and cute, but modest enough that i'm not worried about my bust (38d) hanging out too much. the v-neck hits at the perfect spot. the sleeves are the perfect 3/4 length, not too tight and it's not too short on me (5'9""). i'm a light blonde and i don't feel washed out in this. it hides a little belly well without being a tent. also, the lining is super soft and flexible. the only problem is the upper back falls",4
"I love this dress. wearing it is the equivalent as wearing your coziest t-shirt. there is stretch up top if your chest needs it, the neckline is modest, the stripes and geometric pattern are flattering and vibrant, but not gaudy in the slightest. the length is perfect with the shortest part at my knee. silhouette is tight at the natural waist and flares out in the most flowy and flattering way. i got the large. i am 5'7"" and fluctuate between 170 -185 lbs.",4
"I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts), stay put, and wear very well. these are well worth the price.",4
"Good quality shirt. cute design and not sheer. not quite as loose and stretchy as most of retailer's shirt, but good fit.",4
This shirt is really cute.  i love the color and design.  i like wearing it with jeans and sneakers.,4
"Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.",3
"This dress is more of a lounge dress for at home even a belt and nice shoes would. it make it ok for day. 5$2 back is way longer than the front, more so than shown in the picture and the material is not substantial but for a lounge dress or swim
coverup it is fine.",3
I absolutely am obsessed with this poncho! it is the perfect piece for fall and so easy to layer.,4
Love this skirt!  i purchased the chino skirt during the summer and wore it weekly.  this skirt is the fall equivalent!  flattering and true to size!  there is some stretch to it so it's very comfortable.  highly recommend!,4
"I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!",1
"Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!",4
"Pretty top, i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.",2
I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!,4
Adorable denim dress! fabric is lighter than i imagined but is very flattering. perfect length. this is not a form fitting dress at all so if you're going for that pass on the dress or possibly order a size down.,4
"Just buy these! i bought the olive green color and loved them, so i bought the navy blue. they fit true to size, i'm a size 4 and bought the 27. they are comfortable and make your bum look good. i prefer skirts, dresses and shorter pants like these gauchos instead of shorty shorts during the summer, and these will be something i wear all the time in warm weather. you can wear them casually or dress them up.",4
"This shirt is so soft and lovely, i will be wearing it a lot...after i make one little adjustment. i don't mind some cleavage, but the bottom of the slit in the middle of this shirt goes all the way down to my bra and i feel like i'm showing a lot of side boob...inner side boob?...cleavage? i don't know what the word is, but it definitely feels out of place in a professional setting. however, i'm going to sew a hook and eye onto the top of the slit so i can close it and it will be more like a ke",3
"This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts, and the cut is very flattering. however - the ""white"" is actually ivory. not a big deal, unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not.",3
"The hemline on this is somewhat see through and that makes this denim skirt really stylish. the waist runs small so i had to return my size for the next size up which was still a bit snug. but the skirt is so far beyond the normal, ho-hum denim skirt i just have to keep it. at 5'3"" it hits just right, slightly above the knee.",3
"Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.",2
"I really love the top but fyi it's really an open front vest and the under tank doesn't come with it. it's nice because you can mix it up with different colors underneath, but i think they should have noted that fact in case you weren't prepared to receive half of what you thought you were purchasing.",3
"The material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey. super flattering; defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy. the purple color is lovely, perfect for fall. for reference, i'm 5'1, 32dd, 118 lbs with hourglass figure.",4
I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.,3
"This top has great detailing and color. does run a little big, but adds to the style and movement of the tank. the stitching around the bottom makes it cute for layering.",4
"I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2"" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size.",4
"Love everything about it!! chunky, comfortable, lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!",4
"I adore this little sweater- the pictures don't do it justice. i'm tall, with broad shoulders and small chest- the cut and design of this sweater is so flattering. colors work with denim or any neutral, and the weight is perfect for spring or early summer.",4
"I bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist & bottom hemline. i'm pear-shaped so it's an awkward fit. i'll wear it tucked in or belted. they used a lot of material in the sleeves & through the top portion. i wish they hadn't made it such a narrow cut along the bottom.

the sleeves are very pretty. the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough & scratchy. since i got it on sale & like the color, i'm keeping it. i recommend trying this on if you can.",3
"I ordered this in the tangerine and it is so cute. its very comfortable and flattering. i wore a tank under it, but didn't find it to be as sheer as other reviewers. i paired it with slim pants, brown suede ankle boots and a long necklace and it was one of the cutest outfits i have worn in a long time. i got a lot of compliments! i want this in tons of colors/patterns!",4
"The pants are pretty and run true to size, but the fabric is bathing suit like, very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.",1
"I'll admit, it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined, so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length, hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest,",4
"Casual comfort with style! fabric is a dream to wear and it flows nicely. not exactly form-fitting, but still flattering. i'm 5'9, 140, and wore the medium.",4
"This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however, after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.",2
"I love this dress so much. it is more comfortable than any of my pajamas and the best part is it is very work appropriate, especially paired with chambray shirt buttoned and then tied at the waist.",4
"Super cute dress, the material is not what i expected. it's stretchy and the slip is tight fitting too. the look is super cute though!",3
I would buy these in every color! they're incredibly soft and stylish and feel like wearing pj's in public!,4
"I love the embroidery detailing on the top. i think this shirt looks better in person than online.

i'm an hourglass shape, and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest, but this top drapes down nicely. however, loose shirts like this aren't my style, so i belt this at my waist, and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider), and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10""). i also appreciate that the armholes are small,",4
"Lovely, but i am sensitive to some fabrics and i couldn't bear the feel of this lace. wish it had worked, so pretty in the picture!",3
"I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller, it would work for you.",2
"I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully.

i especially love the design of the trench with the wider, pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone's figure. this is a fantastic, unique design for",4
"I love this top! it falls in a romantic and easy way.  it's very flattering and looks great.  i just had a baby two weeks ago so it hides my insecurities and post baby bump.  i had many compliments and felt so comfortable, so ordered it in the green color.  i wish there were more!!",4
"It's hard purchasing clothes online. i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring. when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee. if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size, i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect.",4
"This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.",4
"It's the perfect long, loose t-shirt. flattering without being fitted. love it!",4
"I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way.",3
"Love this blouse, it;s super comfy, looks awesome with jeans. this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small.",4
"This dress has a beautiful pattern, and is perfect for work. i wore it with tights recently, but could see wearing it in the summer too- the print is versatile enough that it translates. the top layer is sort of a crepe like fabric and there were a lot of strings that needed to be cut that were hanging off. i got many compliments the first time i wore this! i'm very curvy and i got the medium and it fits great and is very flattering.",3
"These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string, which ended up working out, but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites, but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts, as th",3
"The fit of the dress is fabulous! it is so flattering and true to size. my only complaint is that he lining can be seen at the neckline. it might just be that the one i received is slightly defective. even with this problem, it is a keeper.",3
"This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style, and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before, and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer, softer, and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w",0
"I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them, they were hugh, even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price, awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.",0
"I first saw this online, and as a long-time wearer of vests, this really caught my eye. once it came into the store i was able to try it on, in grey small, and it was perfection. it just wasn't in the budget so i decided to wait for it to go on sale and watch the website every day. we have 5 stores in my area and when it got down to only 2 having limited availability for a small i sprang into action. the largest store had put it on the ""almost gone"" rack and they had only 2 smalls. i tried them",4
My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.,4
"This is a beautiful dress. the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture, and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful. the waist is very fitted but it didn't feel uncomfortable. i didn't think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned. i do think it is a bit short on the front (it is a high low dress), but at 5'4"" that is not a problem for me. it was true to size for me (135 lbs, 34c).",4
"The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however, the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back.
however, the fabric is beautiful, the fit was perfect (size 2, 5'4"", 106 lbs.), the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to ""sew away"" the ""wings"" on both si",3
I bought this in the plum & love the color. i got this in xs which is my usual size & it's a little bit baggy but i think this is the style of the sweater. the front on me is not as long as pictured but just covers the top of my pants. my daughter liked it so much she bought the exact same one.,3
"These shorts are extremely cute! i usually have a hard time finding shorts i like, but when i saw these the floral and brocade was too nice not to try. the length is good and they are not tight on the thighs, but not too loose either. the material makes them friendly for work as well as outings and running about town. i got my usual size 8 and found that to work perfectly!",4
The fabric is soft and the colors are bright. it fits well over the shoulders and the neckline is placed just right on the chest. the bottom portion of the tank is more of a swing style item than a form fitting tank. i am very pleased with the top and will wear it often.,3
This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.,1
"This dress is even better in person than in the photos online. the colors are vibrant, the material has a nice, warm weight to it, and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special. i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons, as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didn't fall off.

the dress does run a little small, i think - i normally am an extra small, but the small fit me very well.",4
"I was in love with this top as soon as i saw it. i love the patchwork and i think it is well put together. i've worn it once (the day i got it, i was so excited) and washed it and it is still in great shape.
i liked it with the sleeves rolled up and the bottom tucked in, as it was a little longer than i'm used to. but nothing too long. my torso is short.
the material is not thick or heavy. and the sleeves and some patches are kinda thin. nice material, but not something to wear if it's very ch",4
I loved the dress way more in person than online. the fabric is very soft and it is quite beautiful. i wear a large in most retailer tops and a size 8/10 in dresses and the large fit perfect.,3
"I just got this in and i love it! it's happy, super soft, and will be perfect for the fall season in new orleans, since it's not too light but also not heavy. i see myself wearing this often!",4
"I purchased in store to avoid shipping costs. my local stores don't carry xxs, so they are mailing it to me. i usually wear an xs, but it was roomier than i cared for and made it look a bit sloppy on me. this tee is more distressed looking in person than online, as well. i wish it were more refined because the neckline is very feminine & interesting; i would have liked the ability to dress it up more. also, the solid blue and coral are lighter in color than they appear on my monitor. the blue st",3
"This dress looked ok in the hanger, but oh my on was so much better. quality is great, i love the fabric and that it has pockets.
i'm 5'8 and normally a ddd usually a large too...so i worried about the size - the medium fits great everywhere",4
"Very pretty as shown, runs true to size, however fabric is scratchy on skin.",3
"This is my new favorite dress! i can't tell you how flattering it is. i just had a baby a few months ago, and it's the only piece of clothing i actually feel like i look like my old, pre-baby self in! i'm on the shorter side (5'3""#, very busty #because i'm nursing# and about 118 lbs. i got a mp and it fits great. i could have gotten the small, but i feel that would have been too low cut. honestly, love the cut, the pattern, everything about it. would buy again!",4
"Great quality, beautiful print, definitely a steal given its current sale price. it does run large. order a size smaller. works perfect with a belt!",4
"Absolutely adore this dress. soft and comfortable fabric, ankle length but could be knotted in the front to be shorten. i am usually a s but had to buy an xs. the neckline may be a bit too low, if you are flat-chested. if you happen to see this gem in stores... it is a must buy! it will sell out completely in two days. some customer went back to exchange the next day that it had arrived in-stores but it was sold out, so we had to order it. perfect for all seasons and layering.",4
"Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick, but not heavy, and the cutouts in front fall so that you don't really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didn't initially notice, but wasn't really a problem). i'm 5""4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i couldn't wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it's also a bit shorter than i th",4
"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2"" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn.",0
"This worked for me, very elegant, cozy and comfortable.",4
"The skirt is lovely, has beautiful colors , and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level. it's a lot of skirt---yards of material and i like that it is fully lined, but this creates a problem, the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it. the only criticism i have is with the waistband---it's much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt. i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star",3
The quality of this top does not disappoint; but it does run very large. i wear a size 14 and a 40d bra size; & the xl fit more like a xxl and was too big. i am exchanging it for a size smaller. i can't wait to enjoy it!,3
This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.,4
I really like the skirt! it's very comfortable and i can wear it with  so many colors.,4
This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!,4
This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.,4
"I love  this dress. it is beautiful , feminine, and fits perfectly. i am a 4 in a dress size. i have long wait 5,7. . very happy in this simple yet unique dress.",4
This jacket is a neutral color with a subtle print that adds great character. the stitching around the edges is cute. the shape is very flattering and not too boxy as some open jackets can be. a perfect layering piece!,4
"This dress is amazing! it fits true to size, very flattering and the fabric is beautiful!
i am 5'4"" and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch, but others may like the hemline just as it is. i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my knee.
just love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly!",4
"It is such a pretty dress. the pics don't do this dress any justice. the cut and style is so flattering. the colors are gorgeous. you can wear it on a cool evening in summer and well into fall. i absolutely love this dress. even if the material appears a bit rough, there is a slip underneath.",4
"This romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try it...but once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit, there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model. also, the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture. would probably work well for someone with a petite figure.",3
"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes, linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly, while wearing for the first time, i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there",2
Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!),2
"I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.",1
"As soon as you get up close to this sweater, you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou",1
"I love everything about this sweater. it is very well made, beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together. it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one, but none are left. i am 5 ft. tall and weigh about 96 pounds. i can wear a 0 but not in this sweater. it runs very well and i highly recommend it. hope they make more in this style. it is so fresh looking and so comfortable.",4
"I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!",4
I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!,4
I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!,2
Love these! they are thick and comfortable. they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands. definitely recommend!,4
"I am 5'5, 150lb, generally size medium shirt, size 6 or 8 pants and bought a size 8. i have had two c-sections so my stomach has some problem areas, which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit- not this one! i felt good, it hid my problem spots, showed off curves and stays in place! i can't speak to the durability of it yet, however, it makes me feel great, and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit. that in itself makes it worth the price! try it!",4
"I adore the feel and cut of these culottes, but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer. picks, piles, and serious wear and tear after just one day. i feel as if i wasted my money.",1
As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.,2
Thank goodness i looked at everyone's reviews beforehand because i ordered a size up (4) and it fits perfectly. i am usually a size 2 but can definitely tell it wouldn't have fit correctly had i ordered a 2. the orange color works well for either a fall dress with leggins or a spring dress by itself. i love it!,3
"This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews, i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however, this top hangs like a tent. also, the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar",2
"Tried one at the store. love the look and feel of this pants. so soft and flowy! sizing runs large. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. xxsp fits just right. highly recommended!",4
"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr",0

the blue version runs very wide in the hips compareed to the grey, but is very fitted at the top, giving it a trapeze shape. not a good look on my pear shape. the sleeves on the petite size were a better fit, but it was shorter than on the model. the grey is more slender with very snug arms that do stretch out.

a pass for me, even though i love the mostly cotton fa",3
"I own this in the dark blue and adore it. i read reviews later as i was pondering buying the white (why is it so hard to find a white shirt anymore that isn't see-through?!). one of the first reviewers raved that it wasn't see-through. i ordered it and ... nope, it's totally see-through. i tried it on and immediately saw the entire outline of my nude bra, and worse still - my belly button. back it went. i got the green instead. bummer about the white - fabric's different than the others.",3
"This skirt fit, but is very body con. if you are not comfortable with such a tight fit, consider sizing up. overall, the design is beautiful and the fabric is heavy (hides bumps). i plan on ordering one size up, hoping that the waist is not too big.",3
"Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new ""action shots"" show.  i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  i'm 5'3"" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length.",4
I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu,3

Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.,0
"I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them, this skirt is really that fabulous.

"I saw this today and decided to try it on, it fit perfectly! i have a generous bosom 36e, and a large fit without gaping or the button issues a previous reviewer noted. the fabric is comfortable, no itching. too bad it's 90 degrees, i'm ready to wear this.",4
"Oh this skirt is gorgeous but i feel it runs small in the waist!!
i'm sending it back and ordered up- i'm happy i did as today it's sold out.
beautiful and vibrant colors, very well made- just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldn't run on the smaller side!!!",4

"I saw this online and loved it instantly. i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on. it was almost perfect. but sadly, being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could. i think this might be a better dress for the less busty/less curvy. but it is super cute and fun!",3
"I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ",4

great purchase!",4
Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.,4
"Cute, easy fitting dress. i got it in orange, which is a summery, pretty print. i ordered it in petite because i am 5'1"", but the dress is very short, so i'm exchanging it for a regular size. if you're average height, be aware that the dress will be well above the knee.",3
I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,0

"I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it",0
"This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also, the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still, the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.",2
"Retailer, please make these fantastically versatile chinos in tall sizes again! i am 5'11"" and i usually order a size 8. the regular fit hits in the wrong place at the knee and results in the back of the knee fitting and feeling uncomfortable.",2
I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is,2

"This is festival dress epitomized. flowery, flowy, romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern, but also retains heat since it's all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it's still too long! if i hem, i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern.",4
"I am 5'3, curvy and wear a size 12 and these pants look amazing! often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump, however, the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering. even if you don't think culottes will work for your body type- i suggest you give these a try.",4
Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.,4

"I love these pants so much and have worn them so many times in a week! they are comfy and causal, but still chic and presentable. these pants run true to size and are great for so many things- running errands, working out, lounging around, being casual and cool, etc., etc, etc! after buying these on sale, and loving them, i knew i needed more and purchased two more pairs. i definitely recommend these for anyone who wants both comfort and style.",4
"Beautiful pink top.  comfortable, love the color and print , style and sleeves.  good quality.  didn't have the issues with the placement of the bees over my breasts that other reviewers did. the bees were at the sides of my breasts. covered my butt for the most part in jeans. flattering cut.  i got an xs (5'2"", 34b, 115#).",4
"Fun dress to wear, i received numerous compliments on the color and design of the dress. very flowy and comfortable, love it. i wish i had bought a size smaller than i normally wea because it runs large, but an overall great dress",4
"The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch.
i layer it with various camis for a different look each time.
i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade, and goes well with so other many colors.
looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect.
classic yet unique!
runs very true to size.",4
"I really like the style of this top, the open sleeves are subtle. i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment. it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small, but my usual medium worked for me. i am a solid 8.",3
"From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.",0
"I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile, useful and fun, so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.

my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.

the fabric is nice, p",1
"I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person, i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1, which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.",2
"I agree with other reviewers, this print is beautiful, i'd love to see the artists other work...
however, the price is steep for sure!
i was hoping to wear this with my skinny jeans but it is waaaay too short for that! i have an extra long torso so this is not an unusual problem for me, but this one is worse than usual almost like a crop top. unlike other reviewers tho, i would not want to size up. it fits snugly but not tight. the fabric doesn't give much tho, so if you're on the verge of siz",3
"Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected. 
this is a great top for the weekends!",3
"This shirt is very flattering, which is not the case for all peplum tops. v-neck is appropriate for work. looks great with jeans or khakis. highly recommend! only con is that the material is quite thin. 5'3"" 115 lbs and xs fit perfectly.",4
"This is beautiful - the colors are rich (though the pink is slightly more noticeable than the model image. the length was just shy of my knees at 5'7"", and the fit was overall swingy. i am happy with my normal size s, though i would be curious to see how the xs fits too. i suspect that it would be too tight in the shoulders but fit everywhere else better. one major difference that slightly annoys me is that the sleeves are not long as shown in the model shot. the flared portion starts at about m",4
"I am 5'4, 34c, with a pear shape. this dress fit me perfectly in a medium (30 inch natural waist). i had to use a safety pin to keep the bosom from gaping too much, so a smaller chested person would likely not have any issues. however, the material and design were perfectly pinup and work appropriate, so i was willing to make adjustments for it.",3
"I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.

still looking for the perfect dress...",0
"I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldn't tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 5'4"" about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. it's just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so it's great for my life right now! comfortable too!",4
"This is one of the best tops i've ordered. it fits well, it can be worn dressy or casual. what is pictured is what you get. if you are considering this top, it can be worn all year round! the price is not outrageous, and the quality seems it could last for more than one season.",4
"I like the weight of this sweater. it breathes a little but the knit isn't too thin. it is a little see-through, so i like to stick to solids underneath it. it's just a cleaner look than seeing pattern peeking through. great rose color.",4
"Just got both today, skirt and top, and i love how soft the material is. and btw, i learned a valuable lesson from past moth sweater purchases, dry clean; even though the ""how to care for"" tag states hand-washing, d.r.y. clean. the last moth sweater i washed was not in the same shape it was when i first purchased, but i never made that mistake again ;) and it was one of my faves!

i bought this particular top in the large as i wanted the ""boyfriend"" oversized look, and i love the way it drapes o",4
"I love the overall look and comfort of this piece. my only negative is that since it is not lined, the folds in the material on the inside are somewhat noticeable, especially in the shoulder areas. i guess since it is a light color it is more obvious to me, but it is not something that would make me return it. it is comfortable and looks great on.",3
"I'm a big fan of left of center as a brand, and this top is definitely a winner!  the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim. the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like. highly recommend!",4
"This skirt is really adorable, but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top, so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though, super cute!

the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small, hopefully t",4
"Very cute, great fit and super comfortable. perfect for fall with tall boots",4
"I've been buying pilcro for years. they are good quality, comfortable and wear well. my only complaint is (and this a general complaint of all pants today) is that these are cropped. i have a 35"" inseam. these stop well above my ankle but i love the color and the general fit. i'm used to having most of my pants (even those labelled tall) be too short so i don't mind it too much. i feel as though it runs a little big due to how much stretching that happens as you wear them. it's pretty much a tra",3
"I had 3 shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt. it's perfect! great with skinnies/sandals for the spring, or boots/leggings for the fall. great for layering and so versatile...i will get more wear out of this than my 3 clearance shirts combined. i like the slit in the side, it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt. the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less see-through. it's not bad, but i will definitely have to",4
"I thought this dress was beautiful, but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 55 and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride, i would have kept it, but....",4
"This tunic is comfortable and casual. it is as pictured and flattering. the two materials make it flattering. i ordered the white, and it is see through. it really does need a camisole, which i found a little distracting given the fact that it is already layered. i which i had ordered another color, because it is cute.",3
"This top hangs very nicely on me. i got the blue and have received compliments every single time i have worn it. it may help that i'm tallish with long legs. i usually wear it with black leggings and ankle boots. love, love, love it!",4
"Despite being batwing and sort of poncho-like, this sweater is quite flattering on. hangs just right. unique cut and soft fabric.",4
"Beautiful dress, but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist. it runs huge: i'm 5'6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best. there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist. i received a lot of compliments on this dress! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes.",3
"I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the ""girls"" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!",4
Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!,4
"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.",1
"I'm a little on the short side, i was afraid it was going to be too long in the back. the sweater is perfect all the way around. i like the looseness in the front and like the way it lays in the back. the color is great.",4
"I was searching for an ivory cardigan and i ordered this in my usual size small and an extra small. after trying them both on, the xs looked better, i like a more fitted look. a tad tight i the arms when layered but otherwise would have been a good fit, but the acrylic in this garment was too itchy for me around the neck. i thought this might be the case but took a chance anyway. also the pockets add a bit of bulk in the hip area, definitely not something i want.",3
"I'm a huge skort fan from way back, but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack, so when i saw this on line i was excited, and when i saw it in the store, my hopes were confirmed. this is truly a stylish, functional skort!! the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details. love the pockets. you even get a little bonus pocket. the fabric is a beautiful color (moss) and soft, so it hangs in a flattering manner, instead of bunching up. this skort looks grea",4
"I bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures. i don&#39;t think the image does the dress justice - the fit is so flattering and slimming. i feel like it can easily be dressed down too, with a cute jacket in either denim or leather. the material is thinner, and it does wrinkle a bit. the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress, but i just had to have it. :)",4
"Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying.",2
"Love it! easy to wear, true to size. there is a slight texture which makes it very cozy",4
"Love the fit of this top, love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don't go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top, which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though.",3
Material is hard to wear a bra under it,1
These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!,2
"This is a very fitted dress. i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves. there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little. i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry, jacket, even a large sweater over the top. tts. i definitely would not recommend sizing down! i'm a 8/10 and the med is right for me.",4
"Beautiful fabric, but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed, but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look. 

also, the arms and the top portion are a tad small, so if you have a larger bust/arms, this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall, but was no way for me to make it work.",2
"This dress was adorable. i found it to be a little too short for my taste- i'm 5'9"", and it hit mid thigh. i think you would probably see my rear if there were the slightest breeze, but it would be perfect on some shorter. embroidery was beautiful, and i loved the collar.  also a little sheer, but with nude colored under garments, it would've been fine. definitely try it out!",3
Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!,1
"Looks great from the front, but from the side it looks like a maternity top.",2
"I had this in my wish list a long time, ten when sale came along, my size was sold out. however, someone returned it at my local store. i purchased it then tried it on later... why i ended returning it:

fabric was gorgeous, and light, but fall is coming, and i won't wear it until next summer. may get over it by then
the shape is really nice, but the hem hit me in a weird spot on my short muscular legs
as others mentioned, there are spots where the sewing is not ""perfect"" and bulges a little",3
"I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3, it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough, it should work for you!",2
"Beautiful blouse in theory, however, on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it",2
"I saw this in the rockefeller store and picked it right up. i don't wear red so this shade or burgundy was more my color. the fit is perfect (sometimes buy a m at retailer but the small was perfect, which is what i'd wear at in most brands). i was slightly shocked it cost more than the other tops i bought, but it was too pretty to put back. wore with dark flare jeans to dinner that very night!",4
"I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however, the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out",2
"This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely. (i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think.) it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy, so i will probably wear a long silk one th",4
I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors. i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly. the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability. the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting. i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back. it's an absolute staple in my wardrobe now.,4
"I just received this. it is adorable! well made with attention to detail. the cotton is soft and it hugs the body well in the right places. the pattern is actually sewn into the cotton. very cool. it has a sophisticated, elegant and urban vibe to it. this one is a winner.",4
"Get this while you can. it will not last to hit the sales. it is a beautiful top, with very unique colors and pattern-reminds me of key west. it has a slight tent shape at the bottom, which is not how it appears to be, but the cut is very nice and well done. i wouldn't size down, as the armholes are not huge, and then it would be too tight. i will have to cut them about 1/2"" to not bug me, and i'm typically a med, which is the size i got. i could take the sides in about 1"" on each side, which is",4
I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.,3
"This dress is absolute perfection. the quality of the dress is great, the fit is comfortable and it's such a fun summer dress. the slip underneath fits perfectly the outer layer is delicate yet durable.",4
"For some reason they are not replenishing this shirt even though it sells out like wildfire. 
i got a small even though i was pretty sure i needed an extra small. this shirt is pretty wide, not prohibitively wide but not a fitted shirt by any means. i'd love to get this in my size if they ever opt to sell more in the ivory.",4
I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on,2
I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,1
"I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9"" 145lbs with 38"" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.",4
"I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me.",4
Love this top! very flattering and fits true to size! top hits below mid thigh.,3
"I love this dress. length falls as shown on model. i'm not sure if this fits true to size or not. i am normally a medium and kinda wished i would have ordered a large. i find that the neck is too tight and have to loosely tie it. also, the lining is smaller inside and it ends up causing the arm hole areas to roll inwards. so i feel like the back end up being sort of cape like. it's rather weird. the large may have too much material though. but overall, i still love this dress minus those few fla",3
"I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well.",4
"A romantic find. light and airy. the color is slightly darker than shown. the soft, subtle ruffles give it just the right touch.",4
"I don't even know where to begin--this is a dress for all seasons, but especially the holiday season! i bought it specifically for the guise of a holiday part, i can't tell you what a (black) velvet blazer and (black) patent leather heels did for it! the amazing part is that i wore it to work with a cardigan and booties with no problem. my coworkers were amazed but its transition. i have a slim velvet belt with a antique-ish looking clasp that i wore all day with it, too, and that was the cherry",4
I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.,2
"I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3""/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!",4
"Adorable, comfortable dress. the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch. please be advised this dress runs very large, especially through the hips. i normally wear a size 12 and the large was swimming on me. i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size.",4
"I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n",4
"I think of tracy reese as running small, and usually size up, but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage, so you need the right bra.",4
"Very comfortable sweater. tts. i felt the back was a little too low to wear to work, but it works perfectly reversed. tempted to buy it in another color.",4
"This was a lovely skirt. the colors are beautiful, and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirts.
it is very high waisted, and at 5'8"" the length was similar to the model.",4
"I ordered this dress in a size 12. i'm 5'9'' and 180lb. i usually wear size 14 but the 12 fit beautifully. the material has a nice stretch to it so that i think it would still fit whether i gained or loss 10 lbs. when i pulled it out of the box i immediately thought it read ""grandma"", but was pleasantly surprised when i put it on. it is snug in the waist and flares out nicely from there. it hits me on the knee exactly as it does the model in the picture. i plan on wearing this maybe for christma",4
"This dress came with two pieces, a black sheath slip and a sheer pattern top-piece (pictured). it's pull-on and comfortable and flows well. i ordered online but wish i could have selected the pattern, as the fabric differs a little from front to back both in the pattern and intensity of color. overall though, a comfortable, light summer dress.",3
"Love this romper! once on, feels comfy like pjs but looks put together. i find bending forward at the waist helps to get it off and on. tiny complaint is that the top snap shows, even when closed. that is minor. the rest is all good.",4
"Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.",0
"I love clothing with elements that elevate them from basic to extraordinary. this tops does that for me: the black is a rich dark charcoal grey, the modal fabric blend has a nice feel and drapes well. however, the cut is very body conscious and i found both the medium and large tight in the midriff (my problem) area. since i love it so much, i will keep the medium since the sleeves are looser on the large. it looks exactly as pictured and would fit well on someone with a waistline.",3
"I ordered size large and find it too boxy and long. love the hem, although the top is too long in this size so it's a bit hard to judge how it'll look in the right size. the sleeves are cute and different, a bit wide and flowing. be warned, it's sheer which is more apparent from the side view. i could clearly see the garment cleaning instruction tag through the bottom side hem. has potential but not enough for me to reorder in a smaller size.",3
"Love, love, love these leggings! a soft, colorful, comfortable way to show your artistic flare.",4
"Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape, very flattering. however, the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...",2
Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!,0
"I love this top! its so comfortable and light weight! it drapes beautifully, with an overall loose fit but a little slimmer at the bottom. so flattering! i only wish i bought them in every color before they ran out!",4
"I just got this dress in the mail and tried it on. i loved it the fit was perfect tts, and it is very soft and comfortable. however, it appears that the black striped area has bled onto the off white portion and there are stripes of gray across the chest and blotches on the sides of the dress. i am sending it back and ordering another and hoping for the best. i am very concerned that when it is cleaned it will bleed again. i love the dress so much i am willing to risk it, but i am doubtful. so b",2
"This is a sweater i love to look at and wear for any occasion. it looks on me almost exactly like the model picture in the online photo. i'm 5'6"". i bought a small and it fits very loose and comfortable. i would suggest 1 size smaller than usual would fit well. i usually wear small for tops and medium dresses. it is great to layer with a brown or rusty copper large cardigan. it has a somewhat southwest blanket look with its colors of soft apricot and soft brown plus 1 turquoise stripe. it dresse",4
"The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring.",3
Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.,4
"This dress is just lovely--i love the pattern and the cut, and it's very comfortable to wear. i like it because i can wear it just about anywhere, and it's appropriate. you can dress it up or down. i get lots of compliments when i wear it!",4
"I love cotton fabric, so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color, and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once, and today when i put it on again, i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed.",0
"I purchased in the raspberry, love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool, and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.",3
"Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!",0
"Bought these online - sale, and am really happy with them. soft and light material - feel breezy, like a beach pant should!",3
"This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back.",1
Love this shirt. i can dress it up or down. great fit,4
I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure.,4
"The print, layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990's but in a good way! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy, so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large. the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top. i really appreciate that styling detail. 140# 36dd 5'3"" and i chose medium regular length, not petite since i'm older and wanted the length.",4
"Super cute cardigan! can wear it with black tights and boots or shorts when it starts warming up. the color is great! i was hesitant about buying it but thankful i did. will probably buy it in the black, too.",4
"I tried this jacket on and found it extremely flattering. the knit is soft and feels more like a sweater than a jacket in that it isn't constricting. i am usually between a small and medium and the small was plenty big. the fur collar is a special touch. the one i tried on had several loose threads hanging from the seams and the seams puckered a bit here and there. i loved the jacket but did not feel that the quality in construction i would expect was there. however, the fit is so flattering i m",3
"I love the design and color of this cardigan, and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately, it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2"", 105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties, as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring, but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel",2
"Fun to wear inside sneakers or just around the house shoeless. my daughters tried to take them, but i held on to them.",4
"This top is absolutely adorable, fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.",3
"I agree with the other reviewer -- it's refreshing to find a top that isn't all baggy or sheer, which seems to be the current trend right now.
_______
pros:
- lots of stretch. this was so comfortable and the rayon lining inside really makes this breathable.
- the ruched detailing, sleeves and overall length is great.
- no cami needed with the white. i see in the pics on the model that appears to be cami underneath. i wrote a nude bra and didn't have an issue at the front because it's two la",3
"This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like, but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale, however! then they're all mine!)
this dress is soft, comfortable, classy, and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape, however, because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o",4
"Got this style in both black and green. the fabric is soft and the neck design is very elegant! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",4
"These jeans! i am obsessed. the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy, relaxed feel. i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these. do yourself a favor and buy them!!",4
"These pants are great, as is the case with most c of h jeans.  they are a perfect length if you are 5&#39;5&quot; or shorter (i.e. you don&#39;t need to cuff them several times).  i love the relaxed but chic look.  they run large so definitely size down at least one size.  so happy they were on sale!",3
"This top is so pretty but runs small. i have a 34 dd chest and small back and shoulders . the size 10 was too full cut on the bottom and the 8 was better on the bottom but fit the same on top, felt like the seams under the arms with either size would rip. truly an odd fit and cut. this brand tends to run small and narrow. better for a smaller chest .",3
"This is a beautiful looking dress, but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4, 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked, even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress, and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.",2
"Really great shirt, i made the mistake of ordering normal size (xs) and it was way too small. this is more like ordering in dress shirt size- so think 4, 6, 8, etc, definitely going to have to send back and order up to s or m. will be a keeper once i get the right fit!",4
"I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif, but it sold out so quickly! i tried on about 10 dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner. i got the blue and white motif, which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress. i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable. you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over, or the skirt flying up in the breeze, or needing a strapless bra. the skirt flows really nicely and over",4
"Gorgeous blush color, soft flowing material made for a perfect outdoor summer wedding guest dress. the elastic around the waist could have been slightly tighter as the dress is a bit weighted but not loose enough to deter my purchase. i'm curvy and this dress was very flattering. i'm on the shorter side and didn't buy the petite (it wasn't available in store and i bought this the day before the wedding); i had to pick up the dress to walk up steps but was fine otherwise in 2 inch heels. i receiv",4
"This is a well made and nice looking top.the gathering around the neck adds to the overall look of the shirt, but it also affects the way it fits. i got my usual size medium and it was tight in the shoulders and arm holes. i regret that i had to send it back.",3
"I love this poncho!! it's perfect for chilling saturday mornings at the soccer field. it's a nice warm layer, but doesn't get to hot. pair it with a long sleeve shirt, jeans and some boots and you're set.",4
"Wonderful shirt, soft and flattering... usually wear a medium, but got the large to layer over tanks and leggings. could have easily worn a medium, but large is not frumpy at all",4
"So comfortable, great fit, dress it up with wedges, down with flats,
extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6"" and the length is just slightly cropped.",4
"I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o",4
"I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully, i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference, i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. also, the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said.",3
I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer,1
This is going to be my go to all season. looks great with a sweater dress and boots also looks great with cords!,4
I love this shirt! it's a nice simple long-sleeved tee with some nice details. i especially love the seaming on the front & back-- very flattering!,3
"I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.",4
The pictures don't do this cardi justice. it's so lovely and ladylike. it's seems very well made. please can we have more from this designer??,4
"I don't like how short it is in the back.
i also prefer a solid vs. slubby material, 
back it goes.",3
I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,0
"New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love",4
Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!,4
"This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too, so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.

it's so comfortable and it's made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it's a pretty straight cut.",4
"A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5' 5'', about 135 and the small fits great.",4
"I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt",0
"Soft, pretty design and perfect length. i'm 5'6"" and the m fit perfectly!'",4
"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",0
"What a great little find. it is so soft, and the color blends with everything. a great way to get a few more weeks out of your summer sleeveless dresses, and ease into fall. great with t shirts and pants as well.the collar is flattering over any neckline. it also looks great as a shirt. it really can be worn all year round. i usually wear a size six on top, as ""my girls"" are large. the medium was a perfect fit. and there was no billowing in the back. worth the price, as it will become a go to ja",4
"I'm glad i discovered this super easy to wear, flattering summer dress on a recent store visit. if i had only seen it online, i'm not sure i would have ordered it. i prefer it styled with flat sandals for an effortless boho look. i'm 5'5, slim and small chested and xs fit perfectly.",4
"... runs large which is the opposite of what i see in the majority of others' reviews. since most reviews say it runs true to size i decided to purchased a size 28 which usually, it's the perfect size for me no matter which brand, fabric, style, etc. it always fits... well, not in this case. i should have gotten a size 27. i felt very disappointed because these pants are beautiful. i got the 40% off sale at the time and now can't exchange it since the price has changed and the product is unavail",3
Bought this dress for a wedding in petite. fits true to size. beading & embroidery is beautiful in person. only downside is that the beads & embroidery are very delicate and damage even when sitting on a chair.,3
I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store. this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top. the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person.,4
"I read the previous reviews, but decided to try it out since retailer was having 40% off sale items.
it looks very flattering on me, and great fit for my body type.
i would recommend.",4
"I am 5&#39;4, 125-130lbs, c34 bust. i ordered this dress for a wedding in size 2 and it was too big! exchanged for the size 0 and it fits perfectly. order 1 size down, ladies!",3
"I finally bought this top after eyeing it in the store for sometime. the design adds a bit of edge to a top that could get matronly very quickly. it goes great with a nice pair of jeans and some pumps - you're ready for a night out! my only critique is that i'm a bit busty (38c) so in the center of the top where the v of the neckline meets the shirt, there is some pulling. it's not completely noticeable, and doesn't make it uncomfortable in the least. love this shirt and so happy i finally indul",3
"These are cute...nice overall fit (tts) and length was like model on my 5'7"" frame...quality and comfort were also nice. for me the issue was color...when they came in at first i did a double-take wondering what i had ordered and if it was the right item. the colors are very bright, most notably an almost neon orange. the colors plus the diagonal lines/blue hem combo felt a little clown-like to me. i try to pick versatile items that i can wear multiple ways, and i just couldn't imagine many ways",3
"Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.",4
"This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings. i am 5'4 and usually a 10-12 petite and the s fit well.
the arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build. love the butterfly pattern !",4
I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.,4
I've always been a pilcro fan and they always seem to fit just right. this pair of velvety pants was no different. lightweight velvet and a great cut. yay!,4
I would've looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on. the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy. i'm usually a m but went with the s b/c it looked better fitted. this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy. i can't wait to wear. would look great with white jeans!,4
"I ordered this on the black friday sale. one reviewer mentions that the fabric is thin, and i ordered it anyway because the design was unique. besides, i have another bailey 44 dress and felt that i knew what to expect on quality. when it arrived, i was pleasantly surprised. while not thick, the fabric is a better quality than my other dress. plus, the style is unique and flattering. i am 5'4"", and it hits 2-3 inches above my knee. i will definitely wear it to work with knee boots!",4
"I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc",4
"I got the purple motif and loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. i am 5'6"" and 107lbs., 32d. the small was too big and there were no xs or xxs.",4
Great shirt that is basic with a little something extra. meadow rue does it again...i swear i buy everything they put out...,4
"I tried this top because i loved the not so simple, simpleness of it. however, it was a miss for me. loved the fit and style, which i'd say is pretty true to size, i just didn't love the color on me. i went for the orange one and the color was a bit too bright for my liking. cute top though! for reference i'm a usually small, i'm 5'4"" and a small fit perfectly.",3
Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.,4
"This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!",4
"The colors on the tank were beautiful i didn't keep it because i have a few similar tops, but i liked it! fits true to size with an a line shape",3
"Amazing! they are like those cozy, wool socks. they are true to size. they don't stretch out (at least yet), even after i stretched, etc . i am going to get another pair since i envision wearing these often in the cold house.",4
Great dress with just the right amount of movement and flow everywhere. perfect to dress up for a night out or wear it casually during the day,4
"I wanted to love these, but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft, however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!",2
"Wearing this to a weeding in july. its so feminine and pretty. runs a little big on top at the arm holes, but having it tailored - love!!!!",4
"This is the perfect warm cozy boho sweater. the blue trim really stands out and brightens up the grey. this sweater will look cute over any outfit, or with jeans. i have long arms, and the sleeves almost cover my hands, which i really like. i highly recommend this, especially at 20% off!",4
"This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.",1
"This is a beautiful suit. was looking for a one piece. i ordered online. it is definitely high quality, but i ended up returning it. the colors seemed much more muted than the picture shows. i loved the fit, just wasn't as striking as i expected.",2
"I love the contemporary style of this piece, but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms, it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces.",3
This shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it's definitely a bit form fitting. i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it's a pretty hefty price. but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny.,4
"I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does",4
Simple blazer with cute details - buttons on the back and lining. this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties. i was able to go with the regular size (instead of petite) because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up.,4
If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look,1
"The flow and feel of the material is really nice, however, i think it runs large. i ordered a small, and i have exchanged it for an xs, which i am hoping fits a bit better. i wanted the pants to be a bit more fitted around the hips and flow from there.",3
I looooove these pants. i was looking for a cool pair of white pants since last summer. i tried them on and they make my bootie look great. they are also not see through which i love. i love this brand and these pants will be my new summer staple! ps. they were a bit snug then relaxed a little after 2 wears.,4
"I thought the sweater itself was beautiful, but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.",1
"I love my new maxi dress! as soon as i put it on, i knew this dress would be my go to dress of the summer. i love the styling with the thicker shoulder straps and higher cleavage. you will definitely be able to wear a regular bra with this dress. the material is soft, light, and flows well. i particularly love the ruffle on the bottom of the dress - it adds that extra little feminine touch. i can't wait to wear it.",4
I love western motif so i had to try this t shirt. quality is great..material is high quality. also the length is long..perfect with jeans and jacket or sweater!,4
I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors. i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice!,4
True to size and lovely colors. bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it.,4
"I really like this dress. despite the somewhat gathered skirt, it has a clean line and doesn't add a lot of volume around the hips. the blue is a great color. the length is well above the knee but i'm 5'10"". i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots.",4
"This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3"", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg",4
"I got this sweater in the neutral color, which is very versatile. it is truly, beautifully soft and the design is very pretty -- i really like the different material of the arms and v-neck. the length is good, too, if you like longer sweaters, as i do. the downside: it sheds so badly! sweater is just everywhere after putting it on. i don't think i could wear it out of the house for this reason. another reviewer suggested taking a tape roller to it to make it wearable, but i think that would take",3
"I am in love with this bathing suit. it is super cute and flattering and i love the pattern on this specific style. it is also seems to be very well made. i haven't worn it in the water yet so i can't really speak to that. i would say that i believe it is true to size, which means that it is a little tight since bathing suits need to be tight to stay on in the water! for reference i am a bra size 32dd, around 130 pounds, and 5'5"" and a size 6 fits perfectly.",4
"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash, and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes, go with your larger size.
this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight, so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say, a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b",4
"I was very nervous to buy this top, but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def",4
Love this dress!!! thought the colors would be too much but it actually isn't and is just so cute. got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it! the material is light but not see through at all. the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in. this will be my go to dress this fall!,4
I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.,1
"I picked this dress up from the sales rack at retailer and immediately fell in love when i tried it on. the colors are prettier in person. the cut on the top is a little snug. my bust size is 32b and i got the size 2. i can see the top being an issue for bustier women. overall, wonderful quality and design! i'm wearing it today to combat the 90 degree+ weather.",4
"I am really impressed with the workmanship of this jacket as well as the ""fit."" it really does fit me well and has a ""cool"" look. the quality is really worth the price. thank you retailer!!",4
"I tried on the skirt today in the store and immediately fell in love with how fluid the fabric is and how it looks and feels on, but i had something really awful happen, the zipper was hard to zip up so i just left it partially zipped but close to the top but then when i try to take it off the zipper broke and split down the middle but it was stuck on me! it was the strangest thing that i've ever had happened, and really embarrassing because i had to come out of the fitting room like that to get",3
This skirt is stunning. the red is so vibrant. this will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come. it can be dressed up or down. love it!,4
"This swing tee is amazing! i bought the blue one and the color is true to what it looks like online. the material is so soft and cozy. i am typically an xs and bought an xs, however it runs ever so slightly big. if i had purchased the xxs, it seems like the arms would have been to tight and i'm definitely not a fan of that. whatever the case, i highly recommend this tshirt and love its versatility and that i can wear this all year long.",4
"I was looking for something to wear on jeans fridays. this tunic is super cute and looks great with jeggings. i did find the sizing small for me, but i am busty.",4
"I wanted to love this dress, and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me, however, the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close, so sad",2
"Love these pants, and will wear them all season like a uniform. but, the quality is a little low. made in china, and the black dye may be coming off on white clothes and my skin. i haven't washed them yet, and a little scared to. super comfy, stretchy and still classy despite the quality issues.",3
"I love this shirt but have 1 issue- that darn pocket. it's so awkward. it even looks awkward on the model. then, i bought another t-shirt by the same company from elsewhere and guess what? same awkward weird floppy pocket. it's so odd, i can't even explain it.",3
"I love these pants. only wish they i was a little taller, i'm 5'4"" and the small is a little long for me.",4
"This has such a beautiful shape, goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already. my favorite new piece.",4
This is a beautiful light weight sweater. great for the texas weather. the red is a great color for the holidays too.,4
"I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back.",1
"Love this top! i was worried it would plunge too deep, especially because i'm quite flat chested - but it is perfect. i think it would look gorgeous on a volumptuous woman too. that's the beauty of it. and the color is my absolute favorite right now ... :)",4
"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless, but it didn't work for this short,",2
"I love eva franco 
this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled 
felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.",0
"Very soft material, length is great, a little more loose than i would have liked.",2
"This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great. 

i'm 5""7, 120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s, so i went with the s.",3
"I just got these and had to return them as they were not becoming on my physique. for reference, i'm
5' 5""; 122 lbs; 26"" waist; 38""hips and i have a long torso and short legs. i ordered a 29 petite. the fit
was tight, but they are supposed to fit tight. if i wasn't so ""hippy"" i would have kept them. the model is
slender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute, but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.",3
"Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back, 36c (34d), short waist, and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought, so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front, but not as a high/low top would be. rather, it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater, and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2"", and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid",4
"I *loved* the brown color on the model, and i love the wrap style in general. however, i'm not sure if the color looks as goon on me. i first ordered my standard size small (5'7"", 137 lbs 32 b), which fit, but exchanged it for the looser fit (medium) shown in the pictures. i really like that the material is a thin, but not see through cotton. it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice. the v isn't too low on me, so i don't *have* to wear a cami under. not really crazy about the s",2
"I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6. i am 5'3"", 125lbs with a 36"" bust. the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8. so happy i did! this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure. i also adore the floral print! one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient. i did not object to this characteristic. it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice/",3
I love the pants and it's so soft and they're great. today was the first day i wore them for more than just a try on and i noticed a hole. that's super disappointing but i'm hoping it was just bad luck ;(,3
"I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it wasn't too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i haven't washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time.",3
"I wear this top all the time! perfect with jeans and can't wait to wear with a skirt in the summer.
i am 5'2 and have the xs which hits in a great length, just as pictured. i bought at full price, so for the sale price you are getting a great deal!",4
"I love that these are a nice thin stretchy material (not in a bad or cheap way) because they are perfect for the warm weather as well. i got the color grey in a size 29. i usually wear a 29 in stevie's so they were tts. maybe a bit tight in the beginning but they do stretch a little with wear. i did try on the size 30 but they were a little big around the waist. for reference i am 5'6"", 145lbs, size 6/m. the fit of stevies are perfect and hugs in all the right places. i have wider calves and it",3
"I typically wear a 26 in jeans and in these i got the 25 and they fit perfectly. i ordered the 25 because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got. they are well made, a nice dark wash and with the size 25 a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit. i'm only 5'3"" so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled. i've worn them two days in a row and they haven't stretched out...highly recommend.",4
"I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier, so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in, so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.",4
"Love everything about this dress...cut, color, material and price!",4
"After reading all the reviews i thought i would have to size up. went into my local retailer and found this dress in a size 4 burnt orange color (last one in stock). it was still marked $79 so i think thats why it was still there.. i crossed my fingers and tried it on, it fit perfect! not to short or tight in the upper sleeve. i'm 5'4"" so maybe that's why the lenght was fine on me. if you can find this in your local store try it on. it's really cute and comfortable. i also have the front lace up j",4
"This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.

*highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.",4
"This shirt is very pretty in person, although more orange than it appears in picture. i got it for 25% off the sale price, which was definitely worth it, but i wouldn't have paid more than that. the back has a soft tshirt jersey material with a gray and white print. the neckline is a little weird, gathers kind of strangely, but other than that, a really pretty top.",3
"If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn't just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it.",4
Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy. i havent worn skorts since the 90s and this was such a nice return to that trend. :-),4
"These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers. great fit, classic styling with the pop of the unexpected. the fabric is thinner than it appears--perfect for spring and summer. the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming, but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns (which i do a lot), or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket.. roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day, roll them up for ca",4
"This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend. (one star off for the larger sizing.)",3
"I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles, this dress doesn't work if you're curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge, ordered an xxsp, the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said, ""that looks like something you'd wear if you were pregnan",2
"This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on. i'm 5'3"" and 34dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust. the length is perfect with sandals or even up to 2-inch heels. perfect for travel and summer entertaining!",4
"I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately, i was very disappointed when i received it. it is, as a previous person said, very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy, and in my opinion, did not flatter my shape at all. sadly, i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic, or straight and slender, as you suggest.",2
"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit, flattering silhouette, comfortable fabric, shape enhancing cut, and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd",4
"Tried it on at the store. (must of been a return) at first i wasn't thrilled with this dress.. have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this. the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly. went to a 5 hour dinner that night and was so comfortable. not itchy and i felt very pretty in it. husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again. would not of ordered this online, so glad it was in store. much more vibrant in person . try it you will lik",4
"This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.",4
Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry. true to size. i am a 2/4 and the extra small was great. poofs out a bit but not like you're a fairy. i would say the blue (which i ordered) is more of a seafoam / mint green which is also lovely and spring time.,4
"I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs, 5'5"" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!",2
"This shirt was a cute print, but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88",1
"Soft fabric and long, flattering, perfect for leggings",4
"The fabric is wonderful, flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7"", 145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch"", never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung",2
"This top is unique and gorgeous! i'm a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance. it's got a really great ethnic/bohemian beauty and femininity to it. i saw the top on-line, then i went to the store to try it on. it is delicate- it has beading, embroidery and mesh, so one has to be careful putting on jackets, brushing up against things, etc. but it's well worth it. please note that due to the lining, it does run small, i had to go up a size. depending on how you'd like it to",4
"I love this dress.
it is so cute!
i have another dress from the same brand (hutch) in almost the exact same shape/style so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i love.
i am 5ft 8in and 145lbs, and medium fits perfectly.
it's snug at the top (but not tight) and the skirt is full but not too full.
the fabric is slightly thinner than i expected, but still like it a lot. if i could change one thing, it would be one inch longer....hits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t",4
"I was hesitant to try this duster vest because i'm on the shorter side (5'1 110). i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it! i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long (as it is supposed to be), but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft. definitely a keeper!",4
"The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater, but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall.",4
"The fabric on this dress is gorgeous. i wish it was tailored a bit more because as it is, it looks like a muumuu. i wish it would have fit better, but i returned it.",3
"This is such an amazing take on a white blouse. it's fun and still polished! the fabric is so soft and so easy to dress up or down!

the arm holes run a little small but the cut of everything else is amazing.",4
"I loved the design of these pants, and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up, as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.",2
I bought this top for work but i can also wear it out with friends. it is made well and has a lining that is comfortable and makes it flow nicely. it will be nice for summer. you can tie the neck or just leave the ties down so it has options.,3
After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.,1
"I bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews. they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy. you could belt it, but i won't i'll just wear for errands and lounging, better than my sports tees! i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad, the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage.",3
"Great design & execution - this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck, made of a nice, high-quality jersey. with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it. so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully, no clinging at all. and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater - so pretty.

i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.",4
"I ordered this online, and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head, therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.",1
"Cute, easy to wear. perfect little top! will go with so many things. the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch. i'm a solid 8 with a pretty large chest. i think i need to go up. not sure. about to order a 10 to see if there is a big difference. so, if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes.",4
"These pants are the perfect color, and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose, but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear, i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly, um, saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6, and since the pants are detailed as slim fit, i thought it",1
"I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8"" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.",0
These are the best leggings! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed; i didn't want to take them off. i'm hoping to get a few more pairs.,4
"This is well made and beautiful, but it sometimes slides off so i feel like i'm adjusting it somewhat regularly.",3
"This is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time. i bought it after new year's with the 40% off discount. unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixed.

the quality of the dress is amazing. the details are truly unique. one could tell that the dress is very well made. however, it does run large. i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes! it's very comfortable and it could be dressed up or down.

overall, im happy with the purc",3
I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did. it's actually really cute. the material is soft and super comfortable. the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is. i'm excited to wear this to work! worth the price.,4
"I love this dress in the fact that it isn't low cut, isn't several inches above the knee - and bam it has sleeves! the length is gracious and the all over print flattering for a full figure. the skirt has a wonderful swing to it. i'm 5'4"" and 165, so i ordered the 12 regular. it does fit (and has stretch to the fabric), however it is too long in the torso on me. so much so that the low waist seam pops up and the zipper bumps out when i move around. i pulled up the top by an inch or two and the d",3
"This is the second sweater i've purchased recently that i overlooked online, but fell in love with once i tried it on. it is extremely flattering and the length is perfect. i will be wearing this a lot! i am 5'-7"", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly.",4
"I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes, paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy! 
it's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5'3"" - not so good - had to return, sadly.",2
"This is a great top, not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!",4
"This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .",3
"I really like this top. i am usually a medium in retailer clothing and so i ordered this in medium. it did not fit right across my chest, the empire part cut right across my breast and not underneath like it is supposed to. i returned the top for a large and it fits just right in that area. other than that this top is light and airy, flowy and pretty. i love it!",3
"Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!",4
This dress is beautiful just like the picture. it fits true to size and is quite comfortable considering it is on the delicate side. definitely recommend this one!,4
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,0
"If you're on the fence about this dress - go for it! i am a huge retailer shopper but haven't ever been compelled to write a review until now.  this dress fits beautifully.  the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering, with or without a belt.  i am 5'2, 118 pounds and i purchased the pxs. it's perfect!  i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments. the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out.",4
"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

the stiff fabric of the bo",0
"This dress is so flattering on, i was astounded. often the ""waistline"" in the petite dress are very high, even though i'm only 5'1"" tall, but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall. the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice, but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring. would be great for work, or church, but unfortunately doesn't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price. i highly recommend",4
I really liked this jumpsuit but it just wasn't perfect. the design at the top is a bit stiff compared to the rest of the jumpsuit. i felt the whole thing ran just slightly too large. it was nice - but not amazing.,3
"The ruching on this suit is super flattering. i ordered the medium -- i am 5' 6"", 150 lbs, and usually a solid ""medium"" in most retailer items -- though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy. i was able to get it on (and it certainly held everything in place), but since it is a one piece, pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom. i will be returning and exchanging for a large.",4
"Love this blouse! its so darn cute. the fabric is soft, flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top. it falls at the lower part of my hip. the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in. the body of the shirt, sleeves, cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white. the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowers/butterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow, peach, creamy white, two mauve tones, turquoise and brown. the li",4
"Love this t-shirt! i live in miami and have a 5 month old so i practically live in shorts and t-shirts, and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t. love the material too!",4
"I loved this shirt online and went to my local retailer store the other day and wanted to try it on. i didn't even get past the ""hold it up and measure the length"" test we tall people often do, as it was incredibly short. there is no way i could wear this shirt at 5'11"". 

unless you have a short torso and want to rock the (icky) high-waisted pants that are everywhere right now, this beautiful top might not work for you.

oh, and it's sheer. camisole needed for white and navy.",3
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,4
"The fabric is very nice and it is completely lined, except for the sleeves, which are sheer. i expected the dress to be lighter, so wearing this on a hot day won't work. i ordered an xs because of the former reviews it said it ran large and it does. it's roomy, straight, and quite flowy.  i wanted a casual non clinging dress and it's just like the picture. it hits below the knee.",4
"This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach, and very lovely. as you can see from the photos, the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress, but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green, which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person, which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li",4
"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.",4
"I have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now. i got one from retailer 5 years ago and i've been looking for something just as great. walked into the store and fell absolutely in love. the fit is true to size, i prefer my jackets pretty fitted. the color seemed a bit rosey in the store, but now that i'm home seems more tan and brown. it's not going to be super warm, perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days. it's soft, so soft, not bulky at all. if this is your s",4
Runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small.,3
"I tried on the xs in the store (115 lbs, 30dd chest, short). fit: i think it is a little big, i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me, the length was ok, but would look more flattering in petite. also, the waist was on the looser side. the green color is amazing though, very flattering and springy/summery. the flow of the dress is also very nice. the weird thing is the belt at the waist, it starts a little off from the seam, and doesn't go all the way around, not sure if i love it or",3
"An impulse try on that was immediately moved into the ""yes i'm buying right now"" pile. the tunic is so soft. i have worn as a shirt dress with booties and knee boots/knee socks. the fabric (while not the most forgiving if you buy this tight) is so soft and cozy. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small hands nice and loose all around the body. when this goes on sale, i am buying more colors.",4
"This seems to be designed to fit a bit loose, but not in a bad way (for me). the floral pattern on the collar with the polka dots on the rest of the dress are very cute, and i think this can look good with or without a belt. light for summer but still covers a lot, which is nice for the office. the sleeves are a little short, but it doesn't look bad. glad i snatched it.",3
This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out,4
"I'm in love, i'm in love, and i don't care who knows it. i bought this vest on a whim and i'm so glad i did. it's so soft and cozy. the medium brown color makes it highly versatile as well. i've tried the faux fur vests and they are too bulky for my taste, but this was not bulky at all. warm and hangs well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame and the small was just right. try this vest on...i promise you will be in love!",4
"I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, don't be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.",4
Bought this dress for an indian wedding- it was perfect!,4
I would have liked it but it was too small for me.,3
"I love wide-leg linen pants and i'm always in the market for them. i've purchased these in two colors and have been happy with them so far. the waistband is fold-over and snug. not too tight or too loose. the length is longer than advertised. i'm 5'10"" and typically take a 33.5 or 34"" inseam. these are long enough for me so they have to be a 33"" at least. others may complain, but i'm happy!",4
This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly,4
"I just bought these in store. so great looking. however, i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long. like 6 inches too long. so, i'll hem them, though based on the review that mentions shrinking, i might wash them first to see what happens. great for summer in the city.",3

"Beautiful colors. lightweight flannel, so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round. i ordered a s, my typical size, which turned out to be quite large on me. hopefully the xs will fit better.",4
"I own several of these tops and i love them. i am 5'10, 140 lbs and i wear a small. i bought the gray and white stripe and the ivory and black stripe and they are very flattering. the front hits me at the same place as it does on the model and the back covers my butt. i own several of the solid colors in this style as well and they are just as great. this shirt is so soft and comfortable, you won't regret buying it!",4
"Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.",4

"I love this dress.....but, and it saddened me that there was a but; the material would wrinkle near the sleeves (fit issue) and the high neckline was a little uncomfortable. i ended up returning it, because at this price point, i need perfection. i would definitely recommend this dress, it just wasn't for me.",4
"At the beginning of summer, i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft, open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately, even though these are made of mesh, these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas, new york, new jersey, and florida. i thought they'd be a good, pretty choice. but, the material with the gathered waist & wrists, trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer",2
This shirt is so comfortable and flattering. the quality is really good but i would definitely size down. it's not too heavy and can be worn with skinny jeans/jeggings..,4
This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.,1

"These are lovely, dressy pants, but they act larger than they need to (even for the model above, see photos). i usually order size 8-10 in pants, and size 10 in these fit at the waist but felt bulky below, partly because of large pockets made of the same material. another detail to note: there is metallic thread running thru out the material, glinting more than the photos show. the golden vertical leaflets don't show as much, because of the overall shine. so i will return these lovelies, because",4

"I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it, found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.",3
"You want to buy this! it's so comfy and stylish, yet casual. the sale price is amazing. if anything, the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat. overall, it fits well though. i ordered an xs. i almost want to order the other color i love it so much. i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn!",4
"I have athletic calves from running, so i really struggle with straight/skinny jeans. but these fit me just fine (and don't look like jeggings). i think the slit helps. i have a 29"" inseam and these hit just above the ankle. great find - especially on sale.",4

"I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2, then tried them on a few times, and the smaller size didn't pull at all because it fit me right, the larger one, hung lower and didn't look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too.",4
"Many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women 5'5"" and under should size down and go petite. i am 5'3"" and 101 pounds and the 0 petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down. when i stood up i had to pull the dress down, as it would bunch up around the hips. therefore, the size 2 regular ended up being a perfect fit, no alterations needed. i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi",4
Fits perfectly! i don't think this is too long and i'm a shorty. great style -- wish it came in more colors - i would definitely buy again!,4
"Ok, so maybe i am too picky because the pattern is lovely, the colors are great, the fabric is quality, the fit is flattering, the sizing is appropriate. that said, the high to low hemline shows the inner fabric so it kinda stands out when you are moving and i find it distracting so unfortunately i am returning it. sizing reference, i wear a size 8/10 in pants, i'm 5'3 and the medium petite fit comfortably.",3
I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco,4
"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#",4
"Really like this top. colors are great for summer into fall and beyond. can be worn on or off shoulder. it is longer, but not tunic length. covers your bum. i haven't loved a couple of other off shoulder tops i got at retailer, but this one i do. the fabric isn't ""puffy"" so i don't balloon out under the bust. i am 5'6"" 123lbs and 32d. got the small because i wanted length. would have even got the medium but the neckline was too wide.",3
"This is a fantastic dress for fall, if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l, rather than in particular dress sizes, so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give), but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo), with a tightness at the clavicle, and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.

i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season,",2
"I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black, army green, and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.",4
This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.,4
"This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans, white jeans, shorts, dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!",4
These jeans are very comfortable with a higher waist than average jeans. the material is soft and seems to be quality. the are also stretchy which makes wearing them for long amounts of time very comfortable! i ordered a size 28 and they fit great! i normally wear a 6.,3
"Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!",0
I really liked this cardigan. it is well made and very pretty. i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm.,4
"When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough, but it has a weird under wire, it makes my chest look strange, like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.",2
This robe is such a pretty design. very flowy- runs slightly large in my opinion but was so cute i decided to keep it!,3
"I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small, but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.",3
I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.,2
"This jumpsuit is cuter than it looks online. my store displayed it with a brown belt, which dresses it up. it is perfect for our hot summers with brown or silver sandals. i will wear it with a short sleeve white cotton tee. i'm 5' 7"" and bought the extra small. pricey but worth it, so stylish. so retailer!",3
"I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped, i pounced on the black. sadly, it did nothing for me. i'm a large, sometimes medium, but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price, but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back, uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.",2
"I was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking. per other reviews i took a chance...i love it!
so sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enough...but still casual and fun.
detail work is very nicely done.",4
I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.,4
"Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts. never thought i'd find both in one top. love this! i put it on and knew i had to take it home. it's fitted but not, busy but just enough so, and it's made in the usa! can't go wrong.",4
"Super cute and comfy, perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.",4
"Fell in love with this sweater the minute i saw it. the crocheted front is stunning. the small fit perfectly, 5'5"", 36c. i am usually between a small and medium so if a small is usually roomy you may want to size down. it's a medium weight, soft and comfortable, not at all itchy. perfect for dressing up or down. look forward to many years of use from this fun, classic style cardigan.",4
"I purchased this piece in store in a size small, ivory. i am usually a size medium but the small fit perfect! material is soft, lightweight, and very comfortable. collar can be buttoned to create more of a turtleneck look or unbuttoned to create less of the same look. i'm so glad i grabbed this because it is a great cold weather staple and i doubt they will last long!!",4
"The material is different than i expected, but i like it a lot. the dress is extremely tight fitting, i will be returning it if i can't figure something out. i'm a 36d and wear a 6, very very restricting in the chest/shoulder area. unfortunately, it may just not be designed for my body type. getting the dress on was for sure one of my hardest workouts...and i crossfit. oh, and the bow does not come off at all, so good luck with that. the red color is gorgeous, i hope it works out.",3
"Bought these in both moss and navy. fits perfect, love the style and the roll,down waist. excellent quality.
bought the peachy color top,with the elephants to wear with the moss colored one and received lots of compliments.",4
"I adored this suit - the style, the colors, the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much, it was practically painful! i'm 5'7', 128 lbs, and usually wear a size small, but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on, everything fit well but the length, though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!",2
"I love these pants so much, i have them in two colors. they are super comfy, light and actually really chic. perfect cool girl pants. i have got so many compliments. my young students (4-5) love my ""ninja pants""! i got them on sale. great, great buy. i highly recommend them.",4
This is totally different. great addition to my wardrobe!,4
"I tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasn't sure how much i'd wear it for the price. i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale. i think i prefered the subtlety of the pink/blush color. the maize is a goldenrod yellow, not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture. i'll still keep it because it is super comfy, though the sequins don't show as well as on the blush. it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels. i didn't find it to",3
"These are very well constructed, medium weight, besutiful leggings.",2
"I bought this dress to wear at a wedding. i am short, so i would have really loved the petite, but they were sold out both online and in store when i bought it. i'm making do with high heels. the sheen is gorgeous and the dress is very comfortable over all. i'd also add that i'm pretty curvy and the cut fits my body perfectly.",4
"I bought this dress for my mom! she usually does not even try dresses on because she feels that they highlight her ""problem areas"", but she is going on a vacation soon and i thought she could should bring something different for her trip. thankfully, the embroidered waters shirtdress completely surprised her! the fabric is soft and light, the blue is vibrant and perfect for spring/summer, and the cutwork detailing is flirty without being too risky or revealing. she's really excited about this--a",4
"I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3"" and 114 lbs, i ordered size 4, fir very nice, just front is little to low for me, but i wear ten top , it will be fine. the style and material are amazing, love it!",4
"I ordered the geometric, blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately, it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting, bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference, i'm 5'4"" 120lbs 34 a.",2
"Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however, the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.",1
Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.,4
"The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter, but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!",3
"This coat is wonderful. it's boxy and drapes really nicely. the colors are beautiful and versitile. i love the pockets. the fabric is sturdy, but not heavy. i have nothing but good things to say about this coat. i had to return it, sadly, since it wasn't flattering on my hourglass shape. (i am 5'6"", 34dd-27-42 and the small fit well) if you're confident enough to hide your waste, go for it. your won't regret it.",4
"Cutest dress i own. very flattering, makes your waist look tiny.",4
"I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted, it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic, or less voluminous, it could have worked but nope.",1
"I can tell already that this sweater is going to be in heavy rotation in my closet. it's a bit oversized and cozy, but the ribbon tie makes it neat and not sloppy. great with skinny jeans, flares or leggings. super cute with a cami underneath.",4
I saw this dress in the lilac at the store and loved it immediately! the picture on the website does not do it justice.,4
"I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape, but when i put on the green one, i didn't want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much, i purchased the blue as well. love, love, love!",4
"I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog, but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.",2
So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : ),4
I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.,4
"Don't listen to other reviews- this runs large not small.  i have a 34d and i usually wear a 4 in most retailer dresses.  therefor after reading the reviews, i ordered a 6.  i was swimming in it.  just ordered a 2p and 2 to see which will fit.  the design is stunning and it's very well made.  i'm hoping for the perfect fit once the dresses arrive.",3
This top is so good i bought every. single. color. i sized up for more flow but it does run true to size. this is that sweet little summer top that we all long for!,4
"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"", 160 lbs and have no hips, no butt and no waist. i have no curves and thin muscular legs. it's like wearing a cardigan and dress all in one. i paired it with ivory tights and dark brown boots and received tons of compliments.",4
"Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8"".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.",4
"This is a beautiful dress! great and flattering fit, comfortable, adorable print (the blue is stunning), and nice movement. one can't really see it in the photos, but the skirt is actually pleated. imo this adds interest and originality to the dress. i've been getting lots of compliments. get it while you can!",4
"I tried this dress on in the store but decided to think about it because of price. i ended up buying it later on line. i usually wear a medium (5' 7"" 128 lbs wide shoulders) but got a small in this dress. it does run the risk of looking like a sack but sizing down did the trick! the easy going loosness yet elegance is why i like it. it is so comfy but looks lucious. i plan to wear it often this fall and christmas.",4
"I love this peasant top! i didn't expect it to be made from such nice fabric. usually, i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops, but not this one! i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly. thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes.",4
"I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on, it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.",1
"This is a very lightweight, comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium, though the general fit was better. in the end, the looked medium too sloppy for my taste, and the small felt too small.",2
"I really love this dress but am deciding whether to keep it because, while it fits well in the skirt and around my torso, it is tight in the arms. i can't really lift my arms above should height. the plus is that it would keep me from bidding too much at my kid's school auction. the negative is that it would be hard to dance in.",3
"I love this tunic! it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttons,.i like the slight sheen of the fabric as well. wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort. i'm going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans; i suspect it will also be great to travel in. the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned.",4
"Cute and pretty, runs a little wide and short, just slightly. i feel like i have that issue with all retailer clothes though. love the back.",3
This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater. great length and very soft. it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence. hangs nicely in the back.,4
I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,4
"This is a beautiful well designed top. the pattern is laid out to match on each side. the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric, for an interesting detail, with wonderful construction. this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging . this measures only 1 1/4"" wide and lays flat and finished off well. the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make one's arms look heavy. the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely. i think this top is",4
"I was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it. on the hanger it looked alright, but once i slipped it on, it's like everything i've got going for me disappeared. granted, i'm s little bottom heavy, so these types of dresses don't typically flatter my body type anyways.",2
"Amazing color- true to picture. it runs a bit large, even with layering underneath. i'm usually a 10/12 / l / 34d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit. i'm long-ish in the torso, and this sweater fits just slightly cropped, so really perfect with a longer button down underneath. the buttons on the back are a nice detail.",4
"This general sweatshirt is cute, stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings.",4
"This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however, there's no way that model is 5' 10"" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that, and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress, it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty, but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!",4
"This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.",0
"I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray. it's so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt. the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big, just right. i can't wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer!",4
"I was looking for a classic, white t-shirt that wasn't too big (i.e. a tunic) or too fitted. this was perfect! i love the irregular hemline and the fit. it's not too tight, but not too big either where it looks messy. just a perfect little tee for any wardrobe. runs true to size. i'm a 34d, size 10 and ordered the medium - it fit great!",3
"I ordered this dress online and am struggling to decide about whether to keep it. the fabric is soft and comfortable and has a more casual look. the dress makes my boobs look awesome, but doesn't do much for the rest of my body. the main reason i'm on the fence about keeping it are that i'm not sure if i would wear it to work (the slit goes up fairly high and the fit draws attention to my bust). i think that i would love it for casual wear in the summer but i prefer to invest in dresses that are",3
"Love this vest. it is super soft and cozy yet fits and lays well. not bulky, so it's a great piece to layer over flannels. it has a bit of stretch.",4
"Plan to wear this with pants. may not fit some body types due to the tie and cocoon sleeve styling, but i recommend trying on before deciding. truly stunning athough the weight of the silk is very light. would have been better at this price point if it was heavier weight, but still not a bad value.",4
"Cannot believe this is still available and on sale. am 5' 6 1/2"", 150lbs, size 12 is perfect. this jacket goes with everything i try it with. it is silky smooth but still has structure. is a softer blue than navy. i love it! this is an absolute steal on sale.",4
"I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it, there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....",3
"This dress is versatile and cute! i purchased the xxs at 5'4"" 115lbs and it fit perfect. a steal at the sale price!",4
"These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i'd give it a try, but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b",2
"The reviews are right about these fitting perfectly in the fitting room, i knew right off i had to get them. i have a flat rear end and these make my rear look great! i'm 5'5 about 130 lbs. and i chose the 29. i initially bought both the 28 and 29' to make sure they would not stretch out and the didn't. i didn't want to be squeezed in with the 28. i think they are very well made and i'll love wearing them for a long time.",4
"This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 34 d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i wasn't sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it's really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca",4
"This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don't normally like high waisted ski",4
I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.,2
"I ordered this top in a size 'm' as i heard mara hoffman runs small. the size chart on her site would have me order a size 's' as i have a 33"" bust (33-25-~37). however, my bra size is a 30d or 32c and the size m is what fit. therefore a m might also fit a 34b and a 36a as the back is adjustable. it even stays up without the halter which is highly unusual for me.

the only negative that really disappointed me is that the patterns are not quite symmetrical as i expect from this brand and from t",4
I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.,4
"I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w",2
"I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.",4
This sweater is classy and comfortable. it has an underlay which makes it truly unique.,3
"Love this sweater! warm, cozy and and not ordinary!!! fits great too! no surprises!",4
"Really flattering cut, this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!",4
"Love trying things outside my usual style, thought this might look like a sack but fell in love! looks effortless, easy to accessorize, dress up or down & comfortable. keeper! want to try it with platform sneaks for casual look.",4
"I have been eyeing this top online and initially thought it was very fitted and structured as it appears on the model. upon trying it on at the store, i agree with other reviewers it is a tad boxy. i ended up sizing down to a small and it fits nicely. (5' 8"", 145, usually i take a medium or 6/8 in retailer tops). i can see where this might not work for everyone, but i found it to be a fun take on a classic ""tweedy"" look. i plan to add a pop of color with jewelry or even pair it with the pin",3
"In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l, which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all, a great purchase.",4
"Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7"", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans",4
I ordered this dress on a whim because of the 20% off on mother's day weekend and i am so glad i did. this dress is very flattering. i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but don't make me look fat. this dress has just the right cut. i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering.,4
"I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs. i usually have a hard time finding pants or leggings that are short enough and fit just right. i ordered an xs, and these fit like a glove right away and i was so pleased! i ordered the brown and blue motif. i have only received the blue so far but love them. they hit just right at the ankle and aren't too loose at the bottom. it seems like they are made well but will wait until after the first wash. i'm someone that wears leggings all the time but love that these look like",3
"Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs, which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully, too. i highly recommend this blouse.",4
"Great tee! color is vibrant, material is soft, fits great.",4
"I purchased this dress for a baby shower and it was just perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 pounds and ordered the petite xs which fit great. the dress is supposed to be a tad oversized and flowy so this size worked out great for me! it will also be a nice transition piece into spring with a pair of black fringe booties :) overall, i recommend this dress!!",4
The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.,2
"Very flattering on. i'm 5'4"" /145lbs and took a small. i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on. the only weird thing for me is getting it on?you had to step thru the opening on top, there are no zippers, buttons and if you have larger hips or butt, it will be a challenge to get on. once on, it looks great and believe it or not, roomy.",4
"Love these jeans, fit and style... the wash is a makes them almost more navy blue than blue jean color... but they are soft and fit perfectly. another reviewer described them as mid rise, but they don't fit me that way at all",4
"A bit wide in the torso, but the detail at the bottom of shirt makes up for it.",3
I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don't think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks!,4
"These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it isn't as bright as shown in the pictures, but it's a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25, i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should've stayed with my usual size though, because after wearing for an entire day, the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i'm so disappointed with this",3
"I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable, easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry, it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.",1
"This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas), so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color, but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale.",3
I love this top. i wish i had more like this to cycle into my wardrobe,4
Love it. goes well with a lot. super soft,4
"If you are on the shorter side, do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first, petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size, the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice, but i did end up with the orange one, more ""dressy"", red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt, i had on trousers, and hte orange looked nice with them).",4
"I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!",4
Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.,2
"Disappointed, the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.",1
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.,4
"I ordered this and there is just so much fabric! in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back, in the main photo, to make it look more streamlined. definitely a miss!",2
"I ordered the xl in white. for fit, it's true to size. it matches the model's photos. it's a comfortable top. the shape is good with the pleating. but, the color is definitely off. it's as if the white fabric was pre-washed with navy. it's not the fresh, crisp white shown, at least for the one i received. 

the quality of the material is basic. the black version might be the better one overall. i'm going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try. overall, i don't think it's worth ful",1
"I love this dress. my favorite retailer purchase in years. it is perfect. looks great- no need for ironing and is really sexy for the length and amount of material. i would buy it 10 more times if i could. 

yes!",4
"Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size. for reference i'm 5'3, 117 lbs, 34 b cup, and took an xs. top fits comfortably, no tightness around the chest, and sleeves' fullness isn't overwhelming. the lace is see through, so a cami is a must. top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship. i have not laundered it yet, so i can't comment on that. so happy with my purchase! a keeper for sure!!",4
"I was on the fence about getting this maxi because it's a tad pricey but ended up scoring an retailer coupon that took a bit of the sting out of the price. i'm so glad i went ahead and ordered it! it's absolutely lovely! i'm 5'3"", 117# and got an xs petite; it fits like a glove and is the perfect length to wear with either flats or a higher heel. love, love, love!",4
"This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8, but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size",0
"I love these jeans! they are super soft and just the right weight for year around. however, they do run large. i normally wear a size 27. i am 5'7 and weigh 127#'s. because the other reviewers mentioned the sizing issue, i ordered a size down=26. they were too large and i sent them back for an exchange. these are perfect. i get tons of compliments when i wear them...i would love to see coh make them in a true black.",4
"I love the lacey design of this top. however, it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better, but this size was too short. in addition, the lace didn't lay very flat, and there were lose threads all over. overall, not worth the price.",2
"These sleep pants are very pretty, soft and comfortable. unfortunately, after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?",2
This is the perfect casual top to wear alone or layered with a cardigan. love it!,4
"I tried the size small on at my regular store, and thought the subtle, sophisticated color and the embroidered pattern were beautiful, though the dress was clearly too long for me in the shoulders, neckline and armholes, and the lower hem.

i ordered the small petite online, hoping that it would fit perfectly, but the top of the dress fit the same as the regular size had in the store. the only difference was that the bottom hem was a little shorter and a better length for me.

i bought the dress",3
Cool cut and texture a winner,4
I own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite. the ombre design makes it stand out. the embroidery is beautiful. these are usually tops i throw on during my time off/weekends and i have received many compliments on this one. tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller.,4
The jeans are flatering and stylish. they are slightly distressed but will go with anything. the fit is like other pilcro stet pants i've purchased and loved.,4
As-advertised crop sweater is a great length. design is an iron-on velvet texture rather than intarsia. weight of sweater is great for transitional weather.,4
"Overall, gorgeous blouse; very flattering. i love the sleeves; very unique and also flattering. i love how the blouse is a fit-and-flare from the bust. it's fitted at the bust (but not tight) and drapes with an a-line style. the fit of this blouse is truly flattering to the figure. no issues with inappropriate amounts of cleavage showing or anything. the ties are weighted on the end with metal tubes, which i really like because it makes the strings drape nicely. the back drapes beautifully. i fe",3
I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.,1
"I guess this is a true to size, i am usually a 30dd and ordered 32d, fits great. the back is really pretty, so even though it is a tiny bit looser, i decided to keep it...",4
Loved this online and it did not disappoint. lightweight and super flattering. fabric is sheer with a lovely windowpane pattern. top front of the bodice is lined. looks great with a pair of jeans. super easy to care for. toss in washer in a mesh bag and it comes our perfectly. will likely be a go-to summer piece.,3
Purchased this shirt for holiday photos and it worked great. very flattering and a fun take on plaid. more feminine than your classic plaid button down.,4
This swing dress is very cute and easy to wear. i ordered the orange print and the black because i couldn't decide. the orange looked washed out against my skin color but the black was a keeper. i am usually a small but ordered one in the small and one in the extra small since it is a swing dress and they usually run large. the top is mostly the same fit so i think i may keep the extra small. even still there is a lot of extra fabric. the rayon is a little on the cheap side but it is so comforta,3
Hands down most comfortable bra ever!,4
I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,1
"I bought this top in 2 colors. it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear, so i bought it in the 3rd color. it's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel, weekends, and work. the feel of the fabric is gorgeous, but it pills after wear. so when the top went on sale, i bought an extra set of all 3 colors. now i have a set for play and a set for work. i love this shirt.",3
"I was able to try this one on at the store, and it was so loose on me, i assumed it was a large, but no, it was a small! (i usually wear size 6-8 in dress size, s/m in tops) admittedly, it does pull over the head, with no zippers or elastic to give shape. but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of ""show it,"" plus coverage for wearing around the house, i'm keeping it.",4
"I purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered. all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry. the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable. the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build. i felt these were in general true to size. no doubt i will wear these all winter!
thanks antro!!",4
I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher,3
Like it; but it's quite short and rather boxy. i'll keep it because it's pretty versatile.,2
Love the blouse and the best part is the back side ! this brand never ceases to fall short for fit and style. try it on to see,4
"I bought this kimono only a couple weeks ago...and i think i've worn it six times already! this kimono is stunning. light, airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. the print is unique and bold. i've worn this over a black dress...with leggings and a white tank...with denim and every color top. the options are endless with this beauty! the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things. i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s",4
".... it sheds on my cloths something fierce! not much i can do as i don't want to return it because i love it so. i love the longer panel in the back and the side slits. nice weight and feel, i just wish it didn't shed so much!",3
"I had been eyeing this top online, decided to hit my local retailer to try it on! it is an adorable spring tunic!
i think it runs a size larger then your usual size. for reference, i am 5'7"" and 139 pds, small busted, and i bought a size 6, fits perfect. i will machine wash and hang to dry. happy with my purchase!",4
"Like the previous reviewer, my size 10p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest (36dd wide rib cage 5'3"" 140#). also the skirt flared out too high on my waist. i'm going to try a regular 10 with hope the torso will fit better. other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket, this shirt dress is very well made, very cute",4
"The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.
will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.",1
"Color (orange/red) and fabric nice and good quality
i ordered this since i live in astoria but am glad i did.",4
This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.,4
"I love the design of this blouse. lots of pretty details. the slits on the side are high, but with a tank underneath, it's perfect. love the length of the sleeves and the modest, flattering neckline. the only problems so far are that the rhinestones are prone to falling out and snagging other parts of the top, so you have to be careful with movements and you can't wear a sweater with it because the rhinestones would snag it a lot. even if it loses the rhinestones, it's still a beautiful blouse,",3
"Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy, light-weight and extremely flattering. love!",4
"Very comfy and flattering. cool on a hot day. slightly difficult to use the restroom, though.",3
"I generally wear a size 6, and am 5 ft 3 in in height. the size 6 fell below the knees and did not look right. the fit of the 6 petite is beautiful and flattering. the dress is indeed lovely, and i really want to love this dress as much as others do... however, i am conflicted. i am modest in my style, and even though nothing is revealed, the strategic placement of lace panels makes it a bit suggestive, and takes it out of my comfort zone.",3
"I ordered one of the xl in the red version. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the color is much prettier in person. it looks washed-out on my computer. but, in person, it's a nice light red. the quality of the material is okay. not as good as with the floral version of this style (florascura tank). the layers are flattering for my pear-shape. it definitely needs a tank underneath though. not worth full-price in my opinion but worth getting on sale.",3
Absolutely wonderful! they fit like a dream. you could dress them up or down. i'll probably live in these jeans forever.,4
"This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back. i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves, but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight. the material feels avergage in quality, but looks polished with navy blue pants. i received several compliments during my first wear. overall, a very cute shirt!",4
"This sweater is beautifully made from quality yarn. if you are between sizes, you might want to order a size down. i usually fit between a size m and l, depending on the brand. in this sweater i took the medium, but i am debating returning for a small as i would prefer a petite length and the sweater is slightly wide across the upper back. i'm hoping it may be restocked as i would buy this sweater again.",3
This is my new favorite sweater. soft and comfortable and easy to wear to both work and play. being able to wear different things under this makes it very versatile and easy to change looks.,4
"I love this top! shows off the shoulders but a normal bra works. no tank needed. not too boxy looking, all these things i have had a problem in some of the currant tops an retailer. i felt it was flattering and comfortable with some country chic. i found the colors to be a bit more rich than online. there was a tiny bit of puffy fabric around the back upper shoulder, but nothing to worry about. the neckline is a stretchy and close fitting, and that's the part of the top that i don't usually wear i",4
"This wash fits differently than other pilcro jean leggings. the rise is higher and the fit is larger/bulkier through the waist and hips. i love pilcro legging jeans, so the fit difference is kind of disappointing. i recommend trying this wash on first to see if you need a smaller size. i got the same size i always get in this style and this wash is definitely not as flattering as other pairs i own.",3
This top is comfortable and vas easily be dressed up or down! love it,4
"I saw this in my local retailer, and was blown away by how soft it was! the minute i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off. for being a boxy cut, it was surprisingly flattering. i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes, but i could easily zip the size large all the way up. this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend, or with a pretty blouse on under it at work. i know i'll get a ton of use out of it, so i recommend it!",4
I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price. i got them on sale over christmas. they fit well and i really love the striped shirt. the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless,4
"I was sad that this was only online because i wanted to try on the xs and small to compare. i usually wear an xs in most antrho clothes, and i decided to get an xs because i was afraid the peplum part would be large. however, when i got it in the mail, the xs is too small! i tried to get it in a size up, but i couldn't find it. it's a cute shirt, but it runs small. even the length of the shirt is shorter than i would have liked. if they had the correct size, i would have gotten it, but this shir",3
Love this kimono! it is so versatile. it is a one size only so it might be .a bit volumnous for some people.,3
"I am usually an xsp or 0p but i ordered up one size (2p) due to previous reviews complaining about the tight slip. however i definitely did not need to size up. the slip is fine and the outer 'shell' is billowy and i should have stuck with my usual size! when i put it on i was not in love due to the dress being so roomy, but a second check in the mirror showed that the fabric / seams draped well and it overall looked pretty cute. it hits about 2 inches above my knees and therefore seems pretty p",3
"I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model, however, not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.",2
I love this top! fits great n is elegant. great for the workplace n a night out. absolutely beautiful! quality fabric. love love love!,4
They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.,2

I originally purchased this sweater in a size small (5'4 125lbs) and i was swimming in it! i went into the store and exchanged it for a size xs and it still runs a little big. i do love the quality though and its so soft! it's made of a sweatshirt like material which gives it a lazy sunday feel. it is definitely more casual than your typical cardigan but is so cozy! this is quickly becoming a go to for after yoga or just lazy sundays at home. great product!,3
"Deep purple keeps it fall, flower design keeps it feminine, pockets make it fun! love it and can't wait to wear it.",3
I love these pants! i ordered mine in green and retailer definitely offers vanity sizing. but i love them super cute and comfortable. i wish they had more colors available. these were a great buy!,4
"This is so cute...i love the stripe and fringe combo.  i took my typical size, 4. kind of short for a 5'7 frame, but love otherwise.",3
"Like the other reviewers, i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body, so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets",3
"Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me, and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom, it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.",2
"I wore this dress to dinner right after my boyfriend proposed to me! it will be perfect to wear to any bridal event like a bridal shower, rehearsal dinner or engagement party. i ordered a size 0 and 2. the mock neck is a bit snug. there wasn't any difference really between a size 0 or 2 so i kept the size 0 since it fit better in the waist. it's beautifully made and feels like it will hold up well. it's casual but still interesting. it felt just a bit above my knees. a perfect length. i paired i",3
"I tried this on as a fluke.  i work at retailer and like to see the fit of everything so i can talk about it with customers.  
it is so chic!  it makes your butt look amazing!  i tried it on with nude booties, but i could also see it with a great heeled sandal, or flats.  don't overlook this beauty!!",4
"I've passed this dress by a number of times online, but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo. based on the reviews, i ordered my regular size, medium. it fit perfectly. i do think the cut is on the trim side, but it isn't tight or fitted. i probably couldn't eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress. the fabric is buttery soft! the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat. there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so",4
I bought this to go with the pants they had online & i love them together. the sweater seems thin for the price but i still love it.,4

"This jacket is stunning. the vegan leather has a slight shimmer. the waterfall fabric is nice and soft. it's really beautiful and unique. cropped jackets tend to shorten me, but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely. the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight. they were better in the xsp but i won't be wearing any thick sweaters underneath. it fit everywhere else. i'm usually an xxsp, and sized up for the arms. ove",4
I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.,1

"I found this skirt ran very small and i had to go up a size from what i usually wear. maybe it is meant to be worn really tight as the fabric seems to contain a lot of spandex. i really like the longer length. it feels like a good sturdy fabric. i haven't washed it yet, but i'm hoping it doesn't fade or shrink.",3
"This dress is very cute on the model online, but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.",2
Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.,1
"I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse, too.",4
Billowy top - perfect for casual comfort. the topic is definitely not raspberry-- it is a sunset orange. disappointed as i was going for a match. i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name.,2

"I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall. i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine, whimsical top so i ordered a small online. but even then a small is still too big (and i usually wear a medium or an 8 in tops). maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs/waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity-ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust. the front was too short, as well (stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i'm assuming sh",1

"Is a great top for layering over leggings, running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn't look great on me and for the price, i just didn't love it.",2
"Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.",4
"I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though, i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5'5, athletic/slim figure just for reference.",2
"I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful, breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline, upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i",2
"I cannot wait for summer!  
when i received this item i felt the same as the other reviewers. it may be a little pricey for the material.  then i tried it on.  i love it. just add some accessories and let's go!",3
"Beautiful color, bought a small (i am 5'10 and 145 pounds, the length is the only thing that is usually a problem on size small for me) however the chest area was extremely tight and ill fitting i thought, i am only a 34b. i'm returning it. i did think it was pricey for what you get as well. the color was by far the best thing about this dress, it could have been better quality and fit.",3
"My new favorite sweater for layering!! perfect color, length and fit. i am 5""4, 125 and purchased my usual small. if you're on the fence about this one i say try it on it's totally worth it!",4
Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.,0
"I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur",0
"I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.",3
"I tried this on in the store to see if it would be my go to party top and splurge this season. i love the colors, textures, and embellishments. so lovely! ultimately the price and the very flowy fit (particularly in the back) made me put it back. another great item from moulinette soeurs, though!",3
Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.,3
"I love hand knit sweaters. they look expensive. this sweater is pricey and i shied away from the original price. at the reduced price, it is worth it. my sweater is bright blue and pure white so not sure what other reviewer got. however, it is itchy. i admit that i have somewhat sensitive skin so if i cannot wear a silk layer under it, or find a way to make it less itchy on me, i will have to reluctantly return it. i normally wear large but the medium fit fine.",3
The picture doesn't do this justice. this top is amazing in person. i purchased my regular size 2. it is very versatile and the colors are perfect as well as cut and material. worth the money,4
"I purchased the dusty rose. i thought the picture represented the color accurately. the shirt material had a nice thickness and drape. it felt very luxurious. the opening in the front is cut a little low but workable.

in the end i am disappointed in the care information provided by the site. it listed the garment as machine washable but the care label in the garment states it is dry clean only. i would not have purchased it if i would have know that. i am going to have to return it for this rea",3
"I was returning some things when i saw these jeans and had to try them on! they must be magical pants, because they are slimming and very flattering! amazing jeans!",4
"I had to return the 2 for a size 4 and it is still snug in the ribs. i am very petite and usually wear size 0 and xs. the regular length hits me perfectly above the knee as i like. the previous review to order up was good but i'm writing to say i had to go up 2 sizes. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs, small frame.",4
"It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.",4
"Perfection! i am 5'3""/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!",4
I saw this in the store in a display and tried it on. i got it in the sky color which is a lavender blue color. the front and back are both cute. this top can be dressed up or worn with jeans.,4
I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,1
"I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly, anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you",2
"Thought this would be my goto fall ""dressy sweathsirt."" it ran smaller than expected and it just didn't have the drapey sweatshirt shape that i prefer. the detailing on the arms and waistband is to die for though.....",2
This is such a cute top. it runs large...i bought an xs and usually wear a small or medium. it's flowy and comfy. looks great with dark jeans.,4
"This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a",1
"I liked the look of this dress online, so i called my local store and had them hold it in a small and medium because of the reviews. i am a 34dd, and had no issues with the bust on the small dress. it's a pretty, feminine dress and i'm glad they had the 20% off sale when i decided to buy it. the reason i'm writing a review is because the dress here is not the same as the dress in the store. the dress in the store is pictured in the ""get the look"" photo. the dress in the store has cap sleeves, wh",3
"I'm a maeve fan and i really like the design, fabric and details of this dress. unfortunately, the skirt flares out too much and ends in an odd area on my legs. i'm not sure why the silhouette doesn't drape on me as it does on the model. it's like a cut-off a-line flare. have to agree that this dress runs large. i usually wear a m, ordered the s and it's still too big.",3
"I got these on sale mid-summer at retailer and they quickly became my go-to summer slacks for the office. i work in washington dc and jerusalem -- two really hot cities -- and these are comfortable yet professional. with a sleeveless blouse, jacket and heeled sandals they are professional, with flat sandals and a t-shirt perfect for a weekend. they travel quite well and don't instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do. think ahead to next summer and grab them.",3
"I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking, but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!",4
"I'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops, however, jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small, but there is plenty of room, so might have even worn an xs. anyway, the material is great, is well made, wonderful pocketsi, super comfy, but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm 5'6"", 36c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!",4
"Very comfortable and flattering top, but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through, however i saw  the black motif in stores and it's definitely see through.",3
I sized up to my higher size choice and it was snug. not for athletic builds. top was fitted and thighs tight which caused the belly area to pouf out. good for very thin gals. also good if you are long waisted.,3
"I love this top. so much so that i bought it in black and red. i do think it runs a bit big. i normally wear a medium or small. i bought this in extra small and it fits beautifully. can be dressed up or dressed down. love that it is a double layered knit too. the fabric is soft and drappy. this is a staple top. looks great with a pencil skirt tucked in. got lots of compliments when i wore the red one. havent worn the black one yet. for reference im 5'9"" , weigh 125lbs and wear a 34b.",4
"Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more ""rustic"" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit",4
"This shirt fits true to size. i love the cut of the shirt which adds some edge to a basic tee. i know i will wear this all the time throughout the fall and winter months. perfect to wear as is or layer with cardigans, jackets and scarves in cooler weather.",4
"Love the colors!! i'm 5'2"" and the regular goes down to my ankles like a petite dress would normally. if you get petite, it would be as high as it is on the model. the material is comfortable and i can see this as a pretty versatile piece.",4
"These are fabulous pants.  they can easily  be worn to work.  best jeans/pants ever for women with no butts!!  they stay up, and they're comfortable. 
i can't  speak highly enough for these.  don't  ever stop  making them, retailer!!",4
"I tend to go back and forth between small and xs and i""m glad i got the xs... its great and still flow and not huge. to wear alone you need a strapless but i am happy it has adjustable straps. the lace on the back is fabulous snd the colors in this are so lovely! it has olive green and deep orange, two of my fall favs! i wore with my level 99 deep orange linen pants and an olive green little jacket over it. would also be lovely with jeans and booties... a creamy cardigan or a little blazer. i th",4
"I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style, and it fit really nicely. the colors are very nice in person, vibrant. teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing. the sleeves flutter out, and will give a bit more volume, if i would change something that would be it. i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter. i am 115 lbs for reference...",4
This is a great casual summer dress. cute as a cover up but in the black you can definitely wear it for daytime. if you're feeling bare throw on a white button down or chambray.,3
I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.,4
"""does this sweater make my hips look big?"" my wife asked. this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maiden.
.
""no, love, it does not,"" i said, but i looked, to make sure my reflex was also correct. it's a beautiful sweater for my dear bride, mother of our three children, and no, it does not make her hips look big.

in fact, it draws out all her lovely lines and curves, just so. and she is a modest girl, so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhat...um...suppre",4
"I bought this tee for the cute print. otherwise, this tee is nothing special. i usually wear an xs, but bought an xxs, based on how loose the tee looks on the model. it's pretty thin and more like a slub cotton. i think i will hand wash it, just in case.",3
"I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect. there is a little too much fabric in the middle, but it allows the dress the stretch more. the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined, but you really can't see anything through it. i'm 5'2"" and usually purchase the petite, but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee. the petite would have probably been too short.",4
I bought this in an extra small at a store in the lilac color and loved it so much i ordered a white one online 2 days later. they were out of extra sm so i ordered a small which is still ok as it looks cute being on the big flowy side with my jeans. i normally wear a medium in tops. i've received many compliments on these... they are very figure flattering and it's nice they are a little sexy for a loose top because of the open shoulders. i hope they come out with more colors for summer because,4
"I just purchased this sweater, but have not worn it yet as it is still very hot in the va/dc area. the print is super cute in person. it reminds me of a missoni knit pattern. the color is described as gray motif, but it's really more greens and browns, very fall colors. the sweater is soft and comfortable. the knit is fine, not chunky and doesn't add bulk. it is fitted through the chest with an empire waist and flowing over your stomach and hip area; wonderfully forgiving of any extra bulges you",4
"Dress runs a little small, tight on top. so i had to exchange from a size 8 to a size 10. originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the 10 so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense. the material is light and soft, flowers are muted. maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute.",4
Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!,4
"This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture, the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture, even though the rest fit perfectly.",2
I just received this in the green color. it is a true medium jade green. my monitor shows a blue color and that is what i expected. the green is pretty but i would have preferred the blue that was shown. i found this to fit large . the pockets that are barely visible in any of the photos gape open and don't lie flat. i do like this sweater as a very casual jacket alternative on cooler days. the cashmere is a nice weight and is not too precious to wear every day with jeans.,3
"This is such a pretty dress but it didn't do much for my figure.  i'm fairly long-waisted and the dress curved in around my lower rib-cage.  also, the beads were falling off everywhere.  i really wanted it to work but it is going back.",3
"I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare, kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.",4
"I love these shorts!!! they are thin lightweight and not see through. however the reviews are correct. i am usually a size 2 or 4 in shorts. i am 5'1"" 112 pounds and i had to size up to 6.. i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight. the 6 offered me the comfort of more room.. overall nice shorts..",4
"I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.",1
"Love this skirt! the material is so soft and flowy, but holds a nice a-line shape. i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small. i am a 26"" waist and purchased a 4... and i could probably have considered sizing up to the 6 easily as well.",4
"This swimsuit is amazing! i am 5' 4"" and about 135 lbs, and ordered a small. however, i am returning it for an extra small (just a personal preference as i like my swimsuits a bit snug so they don't get loose when wet). the fabric is very forgiving and stretchy (which is why i'm exchanging for a smaller size - i can slide the size small up my legs with ease), but the fabric is also very sturdy (so it seems, i haven't worn it in the water yet obviously). overall, very cute and surprisingly flatte",4
"I love these cozy, fashionable leggings. they are super flattering and thick enough to wear to yoga or out and about in the real world. i will definitely be getting another pair! they seem true to size. i am tall (5'11) and usually wear a lg.",4
"This dress was very cute the first time i wore it, but after my second wear, the bottom layer didn't remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward.",2
I bought the xs and love it. it looks better on than in the picture. it travels well (no wrinkles after being in the suitcase) and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards.,4
"Bought my 3rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise. the other 2 are from previous seasons. love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish. the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic (in blue) at my local store. i liked the pairing and ended up buying both! i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger. i am a 29 (8) while in most other pants at retailer, i am a 6. i am 5'7 and 135 lbs.",4
"I loved this top . it is exactly what i wanted,",4
"This is a simple, light-weight tunic top. the construction is fine. overall, i'm happy to see a basic executed well.",4
"I ordered this only because it was in the stylist's picks, and decided to see what it was about. i ordered a petite, and don't regret it. the petite on my 5'1.5"" falls right by te hips, which is more flattering for a bomber-style top #not sure if descriptions says that, but it is a bit bomber-style#. the color is truly ivory, not as white as hte picture depicts, though now that i look colsely, you do see a contrast with the white top the model is wearing #so don't expect very white#. as mentione",4
"The sweater is a great fit and the styling is very original and wonderful. it will be great with leggings, jeans, or even a straight skirt. i would definitely recommend this sweater.",4
"This top is beautiful.  at the present price, grab it.  the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything.  the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos.",4
"I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric, in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit, because",1
This runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit. i didn't like it as much as i had hoped.,2

"Larger than life in both size and personality. this one runs pretty big however the detailing in the fabric itself and embroidered collar balance that out. it's even more gorgeous in person! 
for reference, i'm 5'7"", 125lb, straight up and down and i usually go for a 4 or 6 / small. i got a 4, but could have easily fit into the 2 or even the 0.",3
"As of late, it's been difficult for me to find clothing at retailer that fit's true-to-size. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs. and i've had to return several pieces because they were too big on me. this versatile piece fits true-to-size. i purchased an xsp. like the previous reviewer, i've tried this with a couple of different long-sleeve shirt and tights combinations. i think this will work in the spring and fall, too as the material is in between heavy and light/airy. great for work.",4
"This skirt is the perfect flirty denim piece for the summer.   it's light weight but good quality.   the only draw back is the waist is quite fitted when zipped.   had to size up.    it's like a pencil skirt on top, which does make it tough to tuck anything in unless it's very thin.   overall, charming skirt.   do love.",3
"Very cute top and nice material, but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small, but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full, probably twice as full as seen in the pictures,which adds interest but was unexpected. also, the arm hole is wide, so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt, which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit, but i'm not sure about this one",2
"I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs, muscular and petite, so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect, i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined, which i think most dresses and skirts should be, so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides, to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline, so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model,",3
This dress is beautiful. it has lovely colors that should compliment many skin types. i bought the dress for my daughter as a graduation gift. i have not given it to her yet so i don't know if it fits or how it fits.,3
I thought the design was adorable. i ordered up bc of reviews and i am glad i did. i am a size 6 so i ordered a size 8. the upsize is needed so u can get into the top part of the romper. otherwise it would be mission impossible. it's a pain to get on and off as all rompers are but it's soo cute it's worth it. had compliments on it the first day i wore it.,3
Love sundry. great quality. if you want a looser more comfy fit size up!,3
"I tried on te regualr size (xs) as that is all they have in my store, and decided to get them anyway, even if a little long on me. why? because htey are so cute rolled up with the yellow color showing!

super comfortable, have not washed htem yet, but hipefully they remain a decent wuality.",4

"Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly.  i am 5'6 and 165lbs, just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it's very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding,",3
"Gorgeous, soft (yak hair, whaa?), versatile sweater. lean fit, not bulky. runs maybe a little large. i'm generally between a s/m in tops, so i ordered both. the s fit really well. the m did too, but a bit bulkier and wide in the hips. i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, 34c. i'll wear this with everything, mostly with leggings or tight jeans with boots.",3
I saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet. and was i right. the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own. its easy and fun and funky. plus it has hidden pockets! beware though this dress seems to run a bit small. i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a 6 or an 8 then possibly go with the larger size. i do have a large bust as well i wear a 34ddd so it shows some clevage but the girls,3
This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually. i consistently wear a size 8/10/m and have this piece in xs. the reviews do not lie - size down!,4
Looks and fits just like the picture. fabric is nice and soft. looking forward to wearing this tunic as soon as the weather cools just a little,4
"I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months, or layer it with a sweater, thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style), but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4, which fit me perfectly. it's nice that",4
"Knitted midi skirts are part of my daily uniform so i was drawn to this one. its high quality showcases intricate details: the pattern on the front is different from that on the back, the hem is asymmetric and is reverse high-low, the flat waist means the skirt is not too voluminous. the colors and pattern are reminiscent of missoni. it should be easy to coordinate with solid tops. wonderful quality and machine washable. i'm 5'5"" and the petite medium fits me as pictured. since i want the back t",4
These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!,4
What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.,4
"Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut",1
"I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable, it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9"", 145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it.",2
"This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7"" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it.",4
I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.,2
"I love this top, beautiful soft fabric , much prettier than picture, can be worn on or off shoulders. extremely flattering, falls to a perfect length , great with shorts, pants or a long skirt.",4
"I ordered this in the burgundy and am in love with the print and color, very feminine without being over the top.
i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a and the 2 fit perfect. the cut is drapey without being maternity like and i appreciate that's it not as long and full as many of the other tops out there, making it easier to wear with some pants or skirts. it even has little snaps to hold your bra strap in place, although i doubt i would use those. this top is appropriate for any age without looking too girly",4
This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing,4
"I am super happy with this purchase. this top is so soft with a nice amount of flow. i'm wearing it with a bolero sweater over it, making it wearable in the fall and in cooler weather. i also purchased this top in the gray/green shade and it lovely as well.",4
Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past!,4
I am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique. be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering.,3
"Love this maxi! gorgeous print, flowy and romantic. in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest- i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8 and it was perfect. i am 5'7"" and it was floor length without tripping me up. looks great on darker skin. i am on the fair side (winter skin!) and the beige color down the middle looked flesh-toned and washed me out a bit, but with a tan this dress will be perfect!",4
"Straight out of the mail, this cozy soft adorable charming sweater was *full* of little pills. i love the embroidery, the swingy slightly oversized fit that doesn't overwhelm and the high snuggle factor. wish this came in other colors and was knitted with a less fussy yarn.",3
"This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste, it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand, usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top",2
"I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt, which emphasized my shape. unfortunately, it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me.",2
"This is huge. i understand that's the style, but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch, and itch and itch!",1
"Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material, fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller, thinner bods.",2
Love the softness of this sweater - it's very flattering without feeling like i am swimming in it. like the other reviewer said - it sheds a lot! the cream is very sheer so i had to wear a tank underneath.,3
The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,1
"Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference, i am 5'6, 135lbs, 34c, 28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi",4
The sweater had a square fit it has a chiffon ruffle at the bottom which i didn't see in the picture.,4
I read the mixed reviews on this tee but i think the fit is flattering and comfortable. i sized down as i do in many retailer tops and it is fitted in the shoulder and chest and then widens away at the waist. the length hits me at the hip--i have worn it layered with a longer tank underneath.,3
"Runs true to size, with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit.",4
"I ordered this in two colors, in my regular size. i washed and laid flat to dry....it shrunk like crazy. i held the one i washed up to the other unworn/unwashed one and it was at least two inches shorter. they may both be going back. i am so sad.",3
I absolutely loooove this skirt! its just as depicted. super comfy and warm. got tons of compliments wearing it. its just adorable. the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters. highly recommend!!,4
"I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu",1
"Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty, complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.",4
"This top is very cute and appears in person just as it does in the picture. fits true to size and the item is made well. i had many complements and it was fun to wear!

unfortunately, i did have to iron it right out of the bag.",4
So cheerful and colorful! love these cozy pj pants!,4
"Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans, i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough, you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft, super cute!",4
"I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers, it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt. i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length (with my height) and amount of material became overwhelming on me. it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well.",3
"The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means, if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right, it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart, so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also, this skirt fir true to size, it wasn't tight, just gappy.",2
"These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing.",3
"I do recommend this dress with some caveats. 1: it'll be difficult to find a bra that won't show straps, and 2: it's very figure flattering so if you're body conscious, particularly tummy",3
"I find this romper looks much more crisp on the picure than in real life. i find it more slouchier and shapeless even though i went with my ""smaller size"". the material is very soft, but thin, that is maybe the reason. i am not sure if i am going to keep. i wanted a bit more stunning look for my money. not saying this might be a great romper for somebody else however",3
"This is a lovely sweater - the ""moss"" color however is really camel, which is what the photo indicates. it fits tts, is all cashmere, and is knit in a brioche stitch that gives it loft and texture that can be seen well in the detail photo. i am generally not a fan of raglan sleeves but in this case it works with the overall construction of the sweater - one that features interesting decreases, lines, and angles. it is very soft, warm, and lightweight, and can be worn as a casual piece or dressed",4

"Great jeans, great cut, great fit & i love the distressed look. the rise was higher than i thought but not a deal-breaker. i typically wear 26 in most brand of jeans & got these in 26.",4
"Absolutely love this little shift!!! i bought it on a whim really. it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80's! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar :-) this is not that sort of velvet. it's also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet. i always find those to have a somewhat ""plastic"" sheen to them. that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur",4
"Was in dire need of black high rise skinny jeans. bought these in a moment of ""treat yo' self"" mentality. absolutely do not regret it. at 5'7"", 27-28 waist, typically a 28 in denim - i got the 27s as i found that they not only fit in the waist, but were more slimming. black ""denim"" typically stretches out in jeans as they are not of the same fabric - these have a great weight, perfect ratio of thickness:stretch, look incredibly sleek paired with anything. high rise keeps my belly in check, and a",4
"I had originally bought this top in one of your stores and loved it!!! got sooo many compliments!!! while reading my e-mail one night, i saw it on sale!! of course i would have bought it anyway!!! now i have 2 of my favorite tops!!!",4
"I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray, bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.",4
Cute shirt. i thought from the model that it would be big so sized down. it's more snug than i expected so will send back and re-order in normal size. might order 1 size up and compare.,4
"I love this top! the neckline is so unusual and so flattering. i am normally either a small or xs, but this fit great in the xs. i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested. great top...highly recommend.",4
"Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me",3
This top is simply amazing! it's a statement top everyone should own! the green is so rich and full of life! and the floral pattern is just beautiful!! i got so many compliments on it and i felt like a million bucks! confident and trendy! love love looovvveee this top!,4
"I've been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase. well worth the price i paid, a bit steep at full price. 

i went with a size medium- i usually take a small/2-4 in retailer tops and these days i'm around a 32c. i'm also tall with long arms. the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and non-closing front so you have some wiggle room. it fits me like it was custom made. 

the material is a lightwei",4
"Not for petite women, you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model. if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment.",2
"I had been looking for a tee to wear under a kimono i bought last year at retailer. the cut out slub tee was the perfect tee. the slate color goes well with the colors in the kimono, along with being a good neutral. this is also a good tee to wear alone with a pair of jeans as it hangs nicely.",3
Tts - bought my usual pilcro size. enjoy the fit of these better than the serif style.,3
"Ok, here is the story: i am 5'5"", 118 lb, 34c. i got a 4 and a 6, both are s tad tight at the chest and shoulder area, but i have big shoulders; i am keeping the 6. there is plenty material at the waist and below, but the dress does not look frumpy, at least on me it does not. i like the picture with the belt and i will wear it that way too. i also like the sleeves, they make it easier to wear at work. the material is lovely and so is the embroidery and cut-out. it really is a sweet summer dress",3
I absolutely love these shorts!!! everything about them is perfect!! i have them in almost every color. they wash beautifully. i don't dry my shorts in the dryer. they fit the same as last years'. i'm thin & pretty straight with little hips. i wear them in a size 28. i tried the 27 & they felt a little snug. i don't like my shorts tight & i like when they can hang down a little with a belt or not (like the model in the picture). i don't find that they stretch out much after wearing but that coul,4
"After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs, so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace",4
"I'm not usually a fan of tees as i'm a little but busty, and don't like material that clings. the color of this tee is gorgeous, though. the neckline is feminine, and it has it enough weight that it moves.
not sure how it'll wash, but will try to keep it out of the dryer.",4
"Loved the material and the feel. however, it does run a bit large on the shoulders so i had to return.",3
"This is so retailer - pretty in pink, unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink, and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips, just like shown on the model). the top has structure, not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms, like me. this top has everything: flair, bright color, unique print, but al",4
"I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on, it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it, but i knew i would not wear it so, unfortunately, it went back.",2
"I am 5-9 1/2"" tall, 150 lbs, i bought the 8 in the honey color. they fit perfectly. there is some stretch and they are super soft! which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes. the length is good since they are capris. also, they did not have my size in store, so they had them shipped, for free, to my home. received them within 3 business days.

i would very much recommend them for a casual, fun look. the honey color will look great with navy, grey, and white for summer.",4
"Lots of pairs of the pilcro serif-- and for some reason, after 5mo or less of normal wear, these have bit the dust. 
i don't dry my denim and do wash on gentle cycles... this pair just doesn't seem to be too happy. began pilling after two washes, just seems to be a different blend of fabric than the others? 

super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp.",2
I wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small. i didn't find that to be the case and think they run true to size,4
"This is a really nice white button-up top. per usual, the cloth ant stone material is awesome! ... and a machine washable blouse! the side buttons are a really cute feature as well. i found this top fit true to size, and i took my usual xs.",4
"Flattering fit and design, but the material is thin and they are semi-sheer. great for lounging and the beach! very comfy!",3
"The fit is slightly loose, but figure flattering, the fabric is semi sheer and the light, coral color is very pretty. however, after one, short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately, i need to return this blouse asap.",2
"I bought these yesterday and i love them! they are super comfortable, and are the perfect length and size. i'm 5'8 and 150. i tried on both the small and medium (small for kicks, but turns out they were a better fit!). the medium fit great too-albeit a little baggy on the thigh. these are now my go to pants for summer, and travel! i can't wait to start wearing them!",4
"This is a charming sweatshirt top with extra details to make it stand out! the front panel has lovely art nouveau style embroidery and cut outs. i'm going to enjoy wearing this with jeans - it looks great with gray or black denim. the colors are fabulous for someone with ""spring"" coloring - the front panel is a very pale peach / peche. i'm 5'4"", 128lbs, with small shoulders and 32c chest, i'm typically a size 2-4 or size xs-s, and ordered an xs. it fits well, a little tighter than on the model -",4

"I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight, i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit.",4
This top is great for spring- it's super light and can be dressed up or down depending on what you're wearing it for. fits true to size and is great quality.,3
Added this dress to my summer wardrobe in the rust color. it's a very relaxed dress. easy to throw on. as others have suggested in going to add a belt to this to add a little more flair. but i love this designer. but it does run large. sizing down helps immensely.,4
"I was expecting a lot more, but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose, just too loose, as it runs very very large i returned it",1
This layered top fits true to size. the style is trendy and cute. the type of fabric is nice. i love the design of the back. i would definitely recommend it. it's worth the money.,4
"I saw a sales associate (sa) wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it. this t-shirt runs very large, so it depends on how one wants to wear it. the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side, super cute. i tried on a regular small and it was still 2 sizes too big and too long on me. i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly, not too fitted and not too loose (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my mother was a great embroider and the ""giddy up"" embroidery work at the neckline and the",4
"I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said, i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we, it is more of a nude color, but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will",3
This is a great everyday top for pairing with jeans or a nice skirt. love the wine/maroon color. super comfy. i took other reviewers' advice and ordered a size up and it was a little too big.,3
I loved the texture and look of this skirt. very classy. but it fits tight-- i usually take a 4 or 6 on skirts depending on where the waistband hits and i could barely squeeze into the 4 and could not get it zipped. i'd need to go a size bigger in this one but now it's unavailable :(,3
Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets,4

"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length.",2
"This is an amazing jacket! it fits perfectly through the shoulders, with enough give to make it comfortable. i love the color and the feel of it, as well. it will be perfect for the spring and summer evenings.",4

i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt.",2

i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight. warm enough for the breeze but not too thick. love it!",4
"Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.",4

The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.,1

I have this top in 3 colors and am waiting for the black to arrive. very soft on the body. we live in fl so lightweight is appreciated. stylish fit that is not ordinary. great colors. will pack well and can be dressed up with a scarf. sleeves run long.,4

"This is long--as it is shown in the picture. i am five 8, and it's actually too long for me. it looks a bit matronly on as it's just so long. i loved the fabric--it's not heavy and it's super soft. i think it runs one size big. it's made very well, and as i stated, it is a nice fabric with a soft hand. it would be nice for a crisp fall day. that being said, the length just isn't right and does nothing for me. i'm five 8 and slender . i definitely do not think a petite woman would like this or be",3
"Love, love, love!
this is true retailer! the color is lovely and it's so soft! i love the seams in the back and the overall ""raw seam"" style.",4
I absolutely love this top! ordered the moss color in size xxs. i am 5'5 105 lbs. i typically wear xs and 0 in retailer clothing. this top is kinda flared/loose fitting so i would size down. the website currently says it's by everleigh but the tag says eri & ali. color is a little darker in person but tie dye effect is spot on. it's beautiful! and super super comfy! i am currently wearing it with my lululemons! but can defin see this top being dressed up with a cute pendant necklace and skinny bla,4
"This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn't appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.",3
Cute top. not sure about the tassels at the sleeves. very flattering in the waist area.,3
"This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however, it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.",1
This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.,3
"Love the tunic. rich color. longer than i thought. i am 5'9"", 140 and it almost comes to mid thigh. also ordered medium - it is roomier than anticipated. but looks good loose and flowing.
overall love the tunic, the shape, style and will have big fun wearing it.",3
"I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back",2
"I wanted this top in a petite xs, but it was sold out so i got the xs. i'm 5'2"" with a 34b bust, and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model, the sleeves are a bit long...they seem a little long on the model, too. i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day. really like the tie neck feature though.",2
"On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick, stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also, the color is a dark, brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.",2
"Was really looking forward to this sweater, but it's not a cardigan, it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made, and extremely soft, but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as ""batwings."" that should have been depicted in one of the photos.",2
"I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi",4
"Shirtdresses are a warm weather favorite for me, and this one will surely make its way into my regular rotation. the outer cotton eyelet is intricate and beautiful. the color, cornflower blue, is endlessly flattering for many complexions. the cut is classic with the twist of the handkerchief hemline, and the length is work appropriate. per a previous reviewer, i sized up to ensure a fit across the bust and am glad i did. overall, the fit is not totally perfect on me, but it's still great and gar",4
"I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress,it really is so pretty,but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly,the cut is not right,for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half,way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection",2
"This is a great top. it does run a bit large but it's intended to be flowing. i got so many compliments the first time i wore the top and its actually quite flattering! great purchase, especially on sale!",3
"I ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type (shorter, thighs)... well, it was ok, but in the end, i dind't keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day, or ""real"" joggers (as in jogging material).

cut was ok, not super flattering, but tapered pants only suit stright legs in my opinion.

material was nice enough, din'dt notice wrikling, but i didn't wwear them, jsut tried them on.
grey color was nice.",3
I am 5'3 and tried this dress on in both a large and medium petite. the dress is supposed to be a lose fit but i found that i was swimming in the large but the medium was perfect. i bought it in a petite which is shorter for my comfort to wear alone but looks great with leggings and sandals for spring or with boots in the winter. the embroidery is beautiful plus it has pockets. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.,4
"Tried this little gem on in the store but they were out of my size. the ladies were so helpful, ordered it, shipped to me directly and i received it amazingly fast - not an easy task when you live off grid in north idaho!
i wore it last night to a st patrick's day party in california and received a ton of compliments. paired it with black leggings and strap or black heels. 
i'm still smiling today, can't wait to wear it again. the fit is flattering and the quality superb.
thanks retailer",4
I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.,4
More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.,4
This fabric feels a little bit like heaven. i would totally wear this out and not just with my jammies. it's adorable and the fabric is so soft. i think i'm in love. i'm 5'2 95 lbs. xxsmall was a perfect fit.,4
"I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2"" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!",4
"I love this blouse, but after i got it i decided i really didn't need another white long blouse. it was more of a want than a need. very stylish and comfy with nice neckline. i love retailer anything. i'm obsessed with this store and every single thing in it. even the smell just makes me happy when i enter the doors.",3
"I ordered a xxs petite based on previous reviews but it was too short and snug in the shoulders. i then tried on the regular xs and it fit nice.y. loose but it is the style (shoulders fit). i usually need xs petite so kind of true to size to me. i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs. color is nice, i liked the blue polka dot with flowery tie neck. the tie. neck is a. nice. on trend feature, can. be tired at different heights for different looks, i think i will keep the xs regular....",4
Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.,4
"Fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a ""box-like"" fit. i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the arms.
the material isn't what i expected but i still love it. the dress has a more textured/thick fabric instead of the light, somewhat silky fabric that the photo portrays.
i am very happy with the color!",3
"I loved this dress on way more than i expected to - the pictures don't do it justice. the fabric is soft and is a really nice weight - heavier than i expected, which makes the dress hang in a really flattering way. the belt doesn't go all the way around, as other reviewers said, but i actually kind of like it that way. i almost didn't try it on based on some of the other reviews, but i'm sooooo glad i did. it's a really cute dress - will look great as is, or with a light cardigan if it's a littl",3
This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!,4
"This is such a lovely blouse! the color is true to the picture. i am a bigger girl--5'9"" and size 12, and i bought the large. the fit was beautiful--it was forgiving on my less-than-perfect midsection, but wasn't billowy at all. it did not pull around the shoulders or bust the way some button-up blouses do.",4
"I have been looking for a cute raincoat forever. they are usually ""just a raincoat"". when this raincoat arrived - i was happy to finally have something that was fun to wear. only issue is a little tightness across the shoulder area - hoping this will just slightly stretch over time. the rest of the raincoat fit perfect and i wouldn't go up a size because of the shoulder issue. i purchased a light pink tie belt to use with it so i can keep the front closed when it is raining. it looks really cute",3
"When i saw this online, i knew i'd have to order it fast--it's just gorgeous. i got it in the mail today and couldn't be happier! i'm usually xs in angel of the north sweaters and this was no exception- it fit great. colors are as pictured.",4
"Got this dress in the mail today, and i am blown away. the fit is amazing! normally i would get an 8 in dresses, sometimes a 6, i got a 6 in this one and it's perfect. hugs in all the right places. everyone needs this dress! i feel like with the style and fit of this dress, it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down. cannot wait to wear this one!",4
"I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a",3

"This dress is super comfortable and flattering.  i went with the stripes (and the p to shorten the length) -- it looks amazing with otk boots.  however, the material isn't very thick; it's more of a fall/spring dress than a winter.  i'm a xs-s p in retailer dresses - i went with the small.  xs would've fit but less flatteringly",4
"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i'm a bit confused on the sizing for this, especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs, and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small, so i'm not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work, because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i'm not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi",2
"I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite, but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated, and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31"" from the shoulder seam to the hem, not 36"" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely, but i just can't",2

I was looking for a dress to conceal my post baby body but wanted to be able to wear it once i lost the extra weight and this dress does the job! the fit is very flattering and it hangs nicely. great material.,4

"This is theoretically a great summer top addition to your wardrobe. i love the floral print - it's bold and lively primary colors on a black background. i'm usually a size small in retailer tops and neither the small nor the medium fit me very well. the small was a bit too fitted everywhere and strangely, the medium gapes at the front when i'm sitting but not standing (i'm 34b otherwise height-weight proportionate with broad shoulders). another reviewer mentioned a design flaw - the floral print i",3
"I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l, this would have looked like a maternity top on me.",1

"Great, easy to wear wrap dress. rich colors are fabulous for fall. the contrasting knit back adds just the right touch to make the dress more interesting as compared to your typical paisley print dress. i ended up with a petite as the length seemed more flattering and the bust line fit better than the regular.",3
This top is awesome! it fits well and has a flattering shape. it's true to size and i love it!,4
"This jacket doesn't look all that special in the photos provided. i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on. it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with 80s power suits. i call this look: ""full sigourney weaver"" and it is marvelous! perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa 1988. so happy with this purchase. highly recommend!",4
"Very comfortable. love the built-in lining. it fits loosely, but i don't like anything binding so it works for me. length is fine, i could easily wear it to work.",4

"I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors, and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season, this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in, but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy, flowy, and the white version is sheer, but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!",4

"My sales assistant/style consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on, and how they fit, and she brought this dress in, with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on. i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug, highlight every bump, and i could not have been more wrong! this dress is wonderful on! it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet. you must try this on to see how flattering it is. i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel.",4
I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!,1

a great work-to-evening option, as well!",4

i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!",4
"This dress is quite adorable - the pattern, slip and bottom lace trim are very nice. i found that this ran large, particularly in the bust. i am a 34c and felt that the xs was still a bit too big. i decided to pass due to the fit and the price, but i will re-visit if it makes it to the sale room. also note that the front buttons are purely decorative, and can't be buttoned to tighten the top up.",3
"I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style, but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design, but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.",1
"As everyone said, the fabric weighs and therefore the romper is flowing gracefully. and it is real soft. you can wear it without bra. it looks so flattering but still feels so comfortable. it is the reason that i placed an order online and it is also the first piece out of the package that i paired with excitement and went out full of contentment. the only thing is that i received mine with the place where the two bands meet with the back broken. i had to sew them all together. it almost felt li",3
"This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric, i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4"", about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee, which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all, i can see mys",4

"This dress looked so cute on the model, but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style, rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4""

"Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.",1

"Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice, and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush, and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress, will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work, with heels for evening. oop, my usual size, fits perfectly (5'4, 110 lbs).",3
Nice dress to wear while seasons are transitioning,2
Overall great romper! i have a long torso and thicker legs so i sized up to a small and i am very happy i did. the shorts are a bit on the shorter side and go upon the sides so another reason to consider sizing up. the quality is great and super soft chambray with a trendy tie up.,3

"I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.",0
"I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off! it's a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering.",4
"I have these pants in a larger size, but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller size.
they are so comfortable and soft and go with everything.
keep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear them.
just wish they would be available in tall!!!",4
"This dress is incredible! let me say that when it first arrived, i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandma's curtain. the print was really overwhelming for my living room. however, i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods. not only was in incredibly flattering, it photographed better than i could have imagined. wouldn't recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion!",4
"This top is really cute and the cap sleeves are perfect -- what i didn't notice from the online photos is that the back of the neckline is also scalloped which is a really sweet detail! however, i thought this t was a little tight through the chest (and i'm only a b cup!) and the fit was a little too boxy. the length was also just a bit wrong for my waistline/hips and in general, reminded me of the tops i used to buy from a popular british clothing catalog. overall, the quality is beautiful and",3
"These wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering; i'm 6' and 160, which translates into curvy territory. i didn't need extra length, and the size 32 was bigger than i need, but not too big. these are very classy looking, and go with sandals to booties for every type of look, summer to winter,  with a breezy top or a cozy sweater.  
the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down: those cuts are not the most flattering for most people. these jeans are smart but trendy;",3
"I'm 5' tall and 95 pounds and ordered this in an xxsp.  it's a little loose but still looks really attractive on my body.  it's warmer and thicker than i thought it would be and lined.  i love it!  taller petites might want to size into regular because even on my super-petite body it hit a few inches above the knees - perfect length for me but will hit higher for those taller.
it's going to become a staple!",4
"I'm in love ... with this super cute dress!!! the material feels so good on my skin and it has more 'body' than it appears on the pic ! i'm 5'2"" 115 lbs - i bought the s petite and it's perfect for me - slightly loose - i could have probably fit in an xs but i like the freedom that the s gives me! it my official spring dress !",4
"I love boiled wool paired with classic silhouettes and this bonette combines best of both. the fabric is soft, not too substantial but still warm for my climate, goes great with many outfit combinations, has a flexible cut for my body type. i chose to to buy the size small and while it's a little tight in the upper sleeves (because my upper arms are chubby) i can work with it when i wear the right top. the medium was a just a bit too boxy for the profile i wanted but i may get it any way in the",4
"I seriously love this top, and at the sale price it's a steal! i ordered the ivory color and it's just as beautiful in person as in the product photos. i thankfully read the reviews and knew that the sleeves would be slit. i think the slit sleeves add more interest to an otherwise basic blouse. it can be dressed up or down and is great for work (at least in my very casual office). the fit is perfect; i ordered my normal size medium and it's definitely true-to-size.",4
"These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants, definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.",4
I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.,1
"Retailer sizes are all over the place. i fell in love with this top, and tried it a couple of times to see if it would work. unfortunately i have to send it back. the design and colors are very good. the side slits are very high, right up to the waist, but the top still looks good. unfortunately it is very small. it still fits because of the long side slits, and is not that tight at the top due to sleeveless, but the fit just wasn't as flattering. it does seem to run 1-2 sizes small, so i a",3
The sleeves are small. should buy a larger size than usual. other than this is perfect.,4
I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,4
"This is a great casual skirt for summer, color pairs well with many tops.",3
"Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei brand. . they run true to size. they are very comfortable and wear well. you can wear them to the office,dress them up or go casual with a tee. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.",4
Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.,0
"I said this ran large because i bought a 16 and i normally need a size 18 (i'm busty) if the item doesn't stretch. but, a size 16 fit me. it's more straight and less blousy, but it does fit. so, if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose, imho you can size down.

the fabric is rayon/polyester that's light and cool. it is semi-sheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine. the top has a double layer in front. one solid and the over-lay of the embroidery. th",4
"I have not had any sort of shedding problem with this jacket. i have worn it open with black jeans and a long necklace, and buttoned with a scarf and jeans. it is really cute! i am 5'4"" and 115 lbs, and i got the small. i wouldn't hesitate, especially since it is now on sale.",4
I am super happy with the t-shirt....it fits true to size and the cut outs are a great detail!! i'm thinking about buying another!!,4
I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.,1
"Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine, however, because of size and price.",2
"I was worried the green might be on the shiny side, but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops, this top runs small, so order up a size. in most of retailer tops, i'm a small or medium, but in this, i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side, but got on sale, so all smiles here.",4
"I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality, but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+",2
"This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.",0
"I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.",4
"I'm normally a size small, but the store only had a large. i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threw-on-my-boyfriends-shirt kind of look. i wear it tied in a knot with leggings.

the shirt is so so so soft and high in quality.",4
"I loved the idea of this dress, but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting, but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs, and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.

the material is soft, but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.",2
These jeans are so comfortable. they are well-made. they are the perfect pair of jeans. the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing. i am going to order these again in the next smaller size.,4
"Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit, i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.",2
"I love this dress, it's very comfortable, slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light, i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall, i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.",4
"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i wanted to love this dress soooo much, i wanted it for holidays, and special occasions, but my broad shoulders and 34d chest worked against me. the criss-crossed bodice accentuated my larger top, and there wasn't enough poof in the skirt to balance me out. i'm sure this will work beautifully on other body types, and i wish it worked on mine too! a sparkly necklace or dangling earrings and a high bun are all you",3
"I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.",1
"Cute top, not great on me. beautiful, bright color.",2
"I love this jumpsuit! i'm 5'3, 122 lbs and the x-s was to big on me. i had to return and order the x-s in petite and the fit was perfect. you can wear it with heels or with slides. i wore it with a thick brown wide belt and some tan open toe shoes. i wore gold earrings and necklace. i got some many compliments and my girl friends asked where i had purchased it. and if. purse i told them retailer;)",4
"This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking, the modern and structured style, and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it, and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby, the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref",1
"I'm so pleased with this cropped chino with all its lovely colors. i have bought 3 colors so far and i love the fit and comfort of these. i'm 5""1, 104 pounds and took the 24p since this runs a size large. my favorite is the lovely moss color which really a brighter mint green and i also love the honey color for spring and summer. these fit slightly slim yet still feel relaxed. love them and highly recommend these!",4
"This top was really cute on someone else, but not on me... on me, ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too, just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season, it is a bit boxy, but looks nice with jeans, white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...",2
"This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased",4
"This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath.",4
This  is more of a cover up than something you would wear out .,1
It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,1
"I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful, and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well, which is not a given for this style top, and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions, and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length, not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried a size s.",2
"Absolutely gorgeous!
words can't describe the beauty of this dress!
i hope they will restock it cause i would order size s (didn't know how it runs).",4
"This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to",2
Nice skirt. texture pattern gives it character. does run a bit large.,4
Good quality tank. very flowy and longer if you are short.,4
I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f,0
The fabric is lovely and the straight leg cut makes these pants a great option for summer. they do run small.,3
Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather,4
I ordered the size xl and it fits me as it does on the model. it's true to size. it is made of a scratchier material but is still comfortable to wear. definitely needs a tank/cami underneath. i love the vintage look. it's worn well & washed well too. i'd love to see more versions in this same style. i'll get good use out of this in the summer and then will layer cardigans over it in the fall.,4
"This is one of the cutest jackets i have ever owned. nice soft material. i have a steamer so won't have to iron this, depends on how picky you'd be about that. great cut. ordered my normal size. sending another jacket back that luckily i hadn't worn yet. i know between the two, i will always pick this one. didn't find the sleeves too long which was good as no petite option. seriously so excited to wear this. :)",4
"I am 5'3"" and 34c and bought the regular xs. it fits exactly as on the model. soft and light and comfortable, but very sheer. cami required (have to try this with both a tucked in cami and a cami bra). great with midi skirts and culottes and maxi skirts and palazzo and flared pants. love!",4
"So i almost returned this top without trying it on because i've been binging on tops with thin blue lines but so glad i didn't!! i'm busty like ddd36 and i weigh 170, but i got the 8 and it fits like a glove! perfection!! plus i got it on sale!! so fab!",4
"I orderd this product in a size large, because i was afraid of it being seamless would make it too tight on my larger chest (32ddd), however the opposite happened. because it doesn't have any kind of seams it is very boxy and not skin tight like i expected, however it still works because it does fit me around my chest comfortably and when worn under something it gives a nice blouson effect. also, the v is a very nice depth- not too deep or too shallow. overall, i'm happy with it because it's a n",3
"I was a little  hesitant to order it.  i am glad i did, it is a great top.",4
"The photo doesn't do it justice. the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans. texture is light and gauze-y, but i don't find it too see-though. sizing was tough- i'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s, and went with the xs on this (ordered both to try), sacrificing some length for a more flattering width. great for the sale price!!!",4
"I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture, feel great on, don't slip in the waist. zero negatives. i can't wait to wear these bad boys out.",4
"This is a very pretty, delicate, comfortable dress. i think it fits tts - maybe even a little large. i got the ps which is my usual size and it fit perfectly.
the only complaint i have is that the photo is misleading. on the dress i received there was nothing to hook the buttons into (no loops as in the photo) so the whole front of the dress has to be unbuttoned. i wish i was able to button 1 or 2 as in the photo.",3
"I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!",4
"The simple shape of this silky & comfortable shift is transported by the fun psychedelic pattern. the fabric is lightweight and drapes very nicely because of the lining. i purchased the size 10 petite to accommodate my 36dd bust/wide rib cage and it fits perfectly. the high neck is fastened with a single hook. versatile and comfortable and a clear winner for spring and summer. for sizing reference my other stats are 5'3"" tall, 140#, m/l on top, s/m on bottom.",4
"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however, the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately, it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction.",2
"I hadn't seen this sweater/jacket online or in store before shopping today. i purchased the ivory. it fits without being bulky whether or not it is zipped. great fit- true to size.the asymmetric zipper is a stylish detail. the pockets are well placed also. it is a perfect spring weight jacket or, i suspect, a comfy fall to winter sweater.",4
I ordered a size xl in ivory. it's prettier in person. there are great details. it shrunk a bit after washing and air-drying. i cut off the layer of chiffon around the neckline to make it more comfortable. a cute summer tank.,3
I love how comfortable this fits and the fantastic pops of color. goes with just about every slip and tank dress i own! a perfect lightweight dress or layering vest with my hot weather wardrobe. can't wait to take this with me on vacation!,4
"I ordered the red/orange but it was much brighter than i expected (felt almost neon). and the dress felt much more casual than i expected from the pictures online. that said, it's a great dress and i am keeping it - just adjusting my expectations/what i plan to wear it for.",3

"Cute top. a little delicate. my top arrived with a rip in the sleeve. fortunately, my tailor was able to fix it.",4
"I thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu. the color is nice, the neck is cute, but the form unflattering. i'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back.",2
"I love this dress because it is different and unique. i agree with others that the torso runs tight. i got lucky and it still fits snuggly. i think that's the look the upper part should get with the bottom more a-line and flowy. 
it's super cute though. the material is truly jeans material, therefore quite heavy and think. maybe not a dress for summer. more spring or fall with a little sweater.",3
"I love this top and find it flattering, but the black and white polka-dotted motif that i purchased definitely has navy blue in it -- not black. kind of disappointing that the color description was so inaccurate.",3
"A great white blouse! i expected this top to be sheer and yet it's quite opaque. i bought the white in a size small, i find it true to size and the silhouette is very flattering. relaxed yet super polished look.",4
"These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2"", 115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit.",4
Love these shorts - got 2 pairs on sale just because it's hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length.,4
Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.,4
This is awesome multi-season dress.,4
"Great idea, but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked, but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success. ( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price, it did not justify a place in my closet?",2
"I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well, no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.",4
"This jacket is extremely soft and comfortable, with a heavier textured fabric. i think it is expensive for what it is--$138--probably best to wait for a sale",2
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!",4
"This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans, and they were worth every penny. i love the fit, the distressing, everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing, which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, but based on some reviews went up to a 32 in these and they are perfect. also, i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle, which is perfect.",4
"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops. 

the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. 

the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good. 

they're also really tight compar",1
"I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.",0
"I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.",2
"I saw this online and thought it was so pretty--so i ordered a large even though i'm usually a medium in retailer shirts. i thought i might need the extra room to layer. i was in the store returning something and they had a medium and a large so i tried both and the large was way too big in my shoulders and chest even with a sweater! the medium was a little tight in my hips-but still

"I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it wasn't for me.",1
It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.,2
I love how you can wear this with a t-shirt or blouse.,4
I found this in the returned section of the store in a large. i am normally a m but the fit would have been too small in the shoulders. it is very light weight and the color is much lighter in person which means it will go right into spring!,4

"I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on, i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts, i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.",1

Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.,2
"Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand, but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in ""yellow"" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better, but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute, but the qua",2
I was looking for a top to go with leggings that didn't look like a sack and this is perfect. the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly. love it.,4
"I liked this bc it is long, ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.",4
"Quite cute, it feels good on. the fit is tts and the colors are bright and just as depicted. i am a medium in most of retailer clothes and this fit nicely.",3
"Love these jeans!! i ordered one pair and liked them so much i ordered another right away! i ordered the 26 regular.
yes, they are too long (i'm 5'4 1/2""# for flats, but look fantastic with heels #i need 2 1/2"" - 3"" to wear with these).

"Cute off-the-shoulder top with a dark floral motif totally on trend for fall. as previous reviews mentioned, material is ribbed, which makes it look a bit like corduroy. but, it is not thick so it just makes it seem more appropriate for colder weather. i think it will be great with skinny jeans and a choker.",3

"I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side, it's gorgeous.",1
"Ordered this dress and still haven't recieved it, but went to my local store today and tried it on in the size i ordered. it was too big. and now i can't get it in my size. so that stinks! quality was good and the dress was comfortable with stretch. i know in going to have to return it once it comes!",4
"I bought a similar tee by velvet by graham and spencer a couple years ago and have been searching for another one ever since. the wide straps are flattering on me because of my broad shoulders. i love the price too, very reasonable. i want one in every color.",4
This is my new favorite dress! my only complaint is the slip is too small and the dress cannot be worn without it. i can't order a size up as the dress would then be huge. not sure what the solution is but the dress itself is stunning.,3
"This jacket is my favorite purchase in a while! i used my last month 50th birthday discount on it!
it is of exceptional materials and quality construction. the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning! it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! my size medium came in the european size 38. for reference, i am an american size 8-10. 
it is comfortable to wear and can easily accomodate large ful",4
"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.",4
"The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though, because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall, very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)",4
"This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks. i love the fit of the small (5''3"" and small/medium build). would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home.",4
"I have too many grey cardigans. i also have a lot of oversized cardis. but i had to have this one because the stitch pattern is so nice and the yarns are so soft and snuggly. how could i resist? the weave is a bit open work but it still keeps me warm & happy. it also lays in a way that doesn't make me look bulky and top heavy, which my body type already is. i feel sorry for the first reviewer who kept getting subpar sweaters. mine arrived brand new in factory cellophane. i would advise that this",4
"The print on this top is even more gorgeous in person. the fit was great, and the removable halter strap is always a plus. this swim top, however, doesn't have padding, and the material is slightly thin, so this could cause an issue for some. overall, however, it looked great. for reference, i am an a cup, and purchase the small.",3
"This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.",4
These are such beautiful cheerful shorts. the floral motif just makes me smile. they do have brocade on them which is nice and dressy. they are perfect for a night out or a day at the beach. i went tts on them. i purchased similar shorts last year in the brown color. very nice shorts to have in your wardrobe..,4
"Top is very cute and wearable, fit is boxy but nice.",4
"Runs very large and way too much fabric. i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger. i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric. may work better on someone with longer torso and taller. i am 5'6.5"" 36c 126lbs",1
"I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4, 107 pounds and i bought the xs, which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.",4
"I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.",2
"I got the dark blue print which is a really pretty pattern. the fabric has a nice crinkly feel and the cut is very forgiving. i thought from the pictures it would be more of a traditional button down with straight lines. it actually is a looser fit but without the trapeze shape of some ""swing"" tops which i have found to be less flattering for those of us who are curvier on the bottom half. it's comfortable and flattering, could be tucked in or worn out and likewise dressed up or worn casually wi",3
"This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.",4
"This is exactly as pictured, and fits as it does on the model in the last picture. my only hang-up is that it's a little pricey for a t-shirt, the fabric is standard t-shirt material, not stiff but also not super soft which i was hoping for. my hubby had no idea what the pattern was til i pointed it out :)",3
"I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it's not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.",4
"These feel so soft and amazing. i especially love that the length work for me, just a tiny bit long and i am 5'4. i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans.",4
"Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic, comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.",4
"First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off.
i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.",2
"I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn",4
"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.

love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate, too. the sale price was a huge bonus.",4
"I've been looking for exactly this. i really love it. it is heavy, but made extremely well and on sale a great price!",4
"I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through.",4
I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.,4
"Hi, when i received this top i tried it on, looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return. the quality is excellent but it just too boxy. fits nothing like it appears on the model.",1
I can't believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.,4
"I can't get enough off-the-shoulder tops. so even though this is out of season, i went for it...in both colors! my only con is the fabric has a slight sheen which cheapens the look a tad. like i'd read in other reviews, it does run a bit small for this cut top - i just wanted a bit more volume in the neck hole and in the waist since i won't be tucking in. if you want it more fitted and ruched around the waist, go for your normal size. i'll be ordering a small in both colors because i know i won'",4
"I first saw this shirt on one of the workers at the retailer stores and it looked beautiful. i loved it so much i had to order it when it came on sale. the fit is a little too short for my liking, but i think i can make it work. also, it does fit a little snug around the arms but it at least it doesn't show your undergarments. overall, i think it is absolutely beautiful. the fabric has a beautiful shimmer to it and it looks easy to dress up for a day at the office or a night on the town, or paired",3
"I'll admit, i had a lot of sticker shock when i saw this was a moth sweater coat at this price point. but i was immediately drawn to it. this is a one of a kind piece for sure. the colors are vibrant, the design is stylish and it is beautifully unstructured. it has a cocoon shape, wool on the outside and a soft knit on the inside. its a bit heavier (as you would expect a wool coat to be.) my absolute favorite part is the print. very classic on top, and very boho on bottom. it is gorgeous. i woul",4
I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,1
"I love this dress and will be purchasing it in other patterns. the fit is incredibly flattering and the fabric is lovely. doesn't wrinkle, easy to wash and wear. i am 5'7, 190lbs, bottom heavy with a 38c bra size. i purchased the size large and it fits me perfectly (though perhaps a little bit snug in the waist). if i wanted a looser fit, an xl would probably work though might be a bit loose on the top. the low back hits just above my bra strap, but does in fact cover all straps. for reference,",4
This dress is really lovely. it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial. it runs very large i just returned mine for 2 sizes down. i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on. the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip. if you are on the fence at least try it. i am glad i did.,4
"I'm 5'10"", 140lbs and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model. hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back. i didn't find it to be too blousey at all. i'm more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum. purchased a size 6 and it fits well over my chest and arms. if you're busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive. great staple to my wardrobe!",4
"Nice thick fabric, lays well. sleeves three quarter but looks great on.",4
This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!,4
"Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)",3
"This blouse is so much cuter in person! and it's more golden than yellow so it's not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear. i tried it on thinking i'd never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try, and wow so perfect! i had to get it and it was on sale. love this and happy to add it to my antro collection!",4
"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to",1
"I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented, it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!",4
"This top is very pretty. it's a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder.",3
"Was worried these pants would make my 5'2"" frame appear even shorter, but no, they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand, but will remember this brand for the future.",4
"Man, this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like",0
"I really like this sweater a lot. it runs huge though. i have a m/l and i'm swimming in it (5'9"" sz 12-14). i like the length and the swingy-ness. there's enough coverage for me to feel comfortable layering it over a bra cami and leggings. the shoulder detail is what makes it. the only downside is that the threads on the reverse side of the embroidery are a little rough, but not enough to bother me. the knitted fabric is soft and cool feeling. i plan on wearing it into fall with ""real pants"" and",3
"This is a very beautiful and well-made skirt. it looks a little like ribbon material. it is very think and lush, and the pockets add a little extra special to it. the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering. even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky. i am 5'1"" with a 27in waist and the size 2 fit really well, just above the knee.",4
"This jacket is a show stopper.  great fabric, beautiful embroidery.  well worth the price.",4
"I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice, but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.",2
"This jacket is really cute! however, the mesh is really fragile. i've had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder. it doesn't fit me tight so i'm not sure how it happened. every time i wear it i'm super paranoid about snagging it on something. like i mentioned before, the jacket is cute. it's lightweight and the design is unique. but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then don't bother. i'm hoping i can return it otherwise that's a lot of",3
"I did like this top, but it was a little big- i bought a size 4 and i have a size 32 chest. the color is great, the fabric is amazing, but it just didn't fit me perfectly. i thought about trying a smaller size, but i just wasn't sure that i would wear it a lot.",3
Love these jeans for summer! i followed the advice of previous reviewers and sized down to a 26. after wearing these for a few hours they stretched a little and fit great!! they look sweet with the palo alto blouse and the embroidered edessa top. highly recommend!,4
"This sweater is beautifully detailed, however, it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas. very pretty. the cut may not be for everyone. it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open, as shown, on my busty top (36d) it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium. i'll keep for early spring! colors are as shown, detail better in person.",4
"I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.",4
"I love everything about this dress. the patterns are gorgeous and the mixture of fabrics and textures are so unique that they make such a beautiful statement. i got this in a 0p after reading review, and am usually a 00p-0p. the dress fit a bit baggy on me but if i can find some way to tighten the belt it would definitely still be wearable. i agree with other reviews that the top is larger. my measurements are 31-24-34...and i felt like the bottom fit comfortably with some room but the waist and",4
I love this dress it is a little sheer so nothing that spanx won't cover. i have worn it a couple of times and have gotten many compliments.,3
This is tee is so soft and the other one in the same brand is the same. love the details also and the color wash.,4
"This jacket is worth every penny! it is light enough to wear when like 55/60 out or good when it is in the 40s with a sweater underneath. the fit and design of the coat is amazing! i love the full collar look - that's my favorite detail of the jacket. loved the green so much, i bought the coral too! i normally wear a 12/14 in clothes and the large was perfect!",4
"This sweater carries alot of weight, more than it appeared. the yellow is more of a bright green/yellow- not a soft color as pictured. it is still a nice layering piece.",3
Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.,1
"I tried this on twice in nyc and loved this jacket. it is so much cuter in person. my only concern is whether the mesh fabric will hold up over time and at this price point it needs to last more than one season. it has adorable embroidery on it, the colors are vibrant. you need to see this in person.",4
The dress runs large so if you go down a size you will be fine. looks awesome on. love it. would definitely recommend,4
Delighted with these. made in the usa was a big selling factor. great quality and fit. will look out for more active wear from this brand.,4
This top is lovely! high quality yet delicate material and is the perfect weight to transition to autumn. the top is oversized yet flattering. paired with leggings it will be the perfect travel outfit for my upcoming trip. i can't wait to wear it over and over again!,4
"I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.",4
"I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work, but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.",1
"Ok so this top runs extremely large. for reference,i am a typical medium but i ended up purchasing an extra-small!!! besides the sizing issue, the style is super cute and perfect for any summer occasion whether casual or more formal. i definitely recommend! (ps. beware it does wrinkle easily lol...)",3
"This initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it. the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a"" hold u in"" feel. therefore, it fits like a glove on!!",4
"This is a super cute top that is a fit and flare design. i think the stylists wanted it to look more straight hence the odd model shots, but this definitely has a flare to it. it also has pockets. it feels a bit artsy to me which isn't normally my style, but the pink and white is just very feminine and pretty. i would say it probably runs a little large because of the style, but i have larger arms, so, the arms were a bit snug in my normal size, but i didn't want to go up in size as the rest fit",3
"I love this top! it's the perfect lightweight top for summer and the details are so feminine and pretty. the fit is extremely flattering. the arm holes are not too large (i.e. do not have to worry about exposing bra). i think you can dress it up with heels, wear it casually with shorts, & also pairs perfectly with kimonos. i'm 5'4, 130 # and i took my usual retailer size in this, size small.",4
"I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy, but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape), and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary, but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size, which helped, and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant, and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath, just bare skin,  but they're so small that i don",4
I loved this top so much i ended up getting it in three colors. it's comfortable and so easy to wear. it does run large though in my opinion. i normally wear a 6 in tops and i bought this is a 2.,4
This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic. the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy. i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out. i am 140# 36dd and bought the size 8.,4
"I received this dress in the mail today, and while it is lovely and the drape is flattering, it will have to go back. i would need it in a xsp as the top is far too large for me, and the dress runs long for a petite.",3
I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!,4
"I love this shirt, bought it at the store. i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit. i love the colors in this short, it's very spring and light weight! love it very much!",4
"This dress is a great weight and it's very comfortable. i'm glad i tried it on when i saw it in the store, i probably would have passed it by online. great detail, lined and not see-through! i'm 5'4 and 115lbs and it's still the 0 is still a little baggy, but that is the style of this dress!",3
"I tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful, but ended up returning it. first, it is very delicate material - i was terrified trying it on. second, i just couldn't make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted. third, it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip. while i didn't think the colors were as deep as the picture, it was still pretty. i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns, but then i know it would have been too short for",3
This blazer is gorgeous. the brocade fabric is beautiful. the color is really a blueish purple/indigo. you can wear it with a black skirt/pants and even jeans. the only downside is that it runs about one size smaller than what it says it is.,3
Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.,4
"This is a lovely dress, with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however, it runs small in the waist, if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.",2
"This top is absolutely gorgeous, but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.",1
"This is a beautiful sweater. the color is not bright red, rather a dark coral. nonetheless it is much better looking in person than in the web photo. i only have one complaint which may be reason enough for me to return an otherwise perfect sweater. i wore this for approximately three hours today and could not believe the pilling under the arms and side of chest area. some pilling is normal and expected on any sweater but if this continues at the rate it appears to be going, i will contact retailer",3
"If you're expecting a sweatshirt when you order this, you might be disappointed. it's actually more like a banded t-shirt, which i don't mind. i'm 5'2"" and the length comes just below the button on my jeans. perfect length for us shorter gals. sleeves are quite long on me, but i like to wear them pushed up anyways (and they actually stay up). i wouldn't pay full price for this, but it's a nice top at the sale price. cute with destroyed jeans or black leggings.",3
"I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors.",4
"Lovelier in person! fit tts; i tried this on, walked away without it and returned to my store to purchase because i couldn't stop thinking about this dress. most definitely can be worn now, but will layer well through the winter - dress it up with heels and accessories or make it casual with a denim jacket and booties :) perfect floor length at 5'3.5"" in the regular 0; tiny bit of room in the bust for a 32b",4
"I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-1 and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!",3
"The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.",4
"The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy, cool professor vibe that i like.",2
"Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be ""short waisted""-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model), which never happens! great quality, thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can't wait to wear it!",4
"Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.",2
"Beautiful dress but runs very large. it is made of a material that does not breath so if you tend to run hot, skip this dress. great style and looks good on almost any body type. colors are very attractive and is dressy enough for special occasions,",3
"I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me, but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built",4
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than i'm used to in my closet, but that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. it runs a little large in the waist. also, the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured. mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh. however, i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come.",4
"Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.

a must have for the summer!!!!!!",4
"Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and",3
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s,4
"I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and tried a small.",2
I sized down in this and it fit perfectly! i normally opt for petite in skirts but i stuck to regular for this skirt and it was much more flattering . adorable and well made!,4
"I ordered the navy in size xl and it fits me just as it does the model. this top is definitely one of my favorite retailer purchases. the cut is very flattering. i love how they designed the tunic to have a closer fit on top, the arms and through the top of the waist and then flow out. i'm a pear-shape and worried the bottom layer might accent my hips, but it all flows really nicely. the arms aren't tight. they're not loose but aren't too poofy.

the material washed well too, without static (a pro",4
"Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very ""retailer"" piece so most likely i will keep it, just a bit disappointed.",2
"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted, it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium, at 5'5"" and 140 pounds.",1
"I picked this up unexpectedly and whisked it into the dressing room a long with a handful of other things today.
i noticed right away how soft it was! so comfy! i have never owned a romper before so i wasn't expecting to like it--- i was so wrong, i'm sorry romper! i love you!
i plan on debuting this little number with a cropped cream cardigan jacket and taupe booties and some layered necklaces for my brother in law's casual weddingrehearsal dinner. 
living in las vegas though, i can definite",4
"I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress, had the fabric been different, i think it would be a great dress.",1
"I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.

the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming",4
"Got this dress in the mail today, and it's definitely a keeper. the material is high quality, and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter. it'll be great to wear today in 90 degree weather, and with a cardigan and booties, it will easily transition into cool weather. the colors, patterns, and lace are all just beautiful. for reference, i always order xs for loose fitting dresses, and a size 4 for close fitting styles. the xs in this dress is perfect.",4
Fit great with moving room. colors very vibrant. just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning!,4
"I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair, and i get non-stop compliments on them. they are very flattering and drape beautifully. the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade. this time, i went for the red pair, and i love them. they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes.",4
"Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft, it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!",4
"This is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale! trust the other reviewers that it does run small! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top, and i got the 4 - and it's a bit snug! it is very fitted below the bust, but that's what makes it look so nice on. i would definitely recommend, but know that sizing is off.",3
Comfy and lightweight - beautiful blue color. sleeves are a bit long but not a bother to me.,3
The embroidery details on this top are beautiful. the material is soft and a really good quality. my first time wearing out and i received so many compliments! i love it!,4
The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me,1
"But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly. 

reference 115 lbs 30dd and 26.5 on waist.",3
"This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.",4
"This is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small. i usually wear an 8, maybe a 10 on a bad day. i couldn't get into the 8, the 10 was uncomfortably tight, and even the 12 was snug (i haven't worn a size 12 anything since i was pregnant years ago). i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any woman's body. since i already have curves, i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse. it was too much for me. again, lovely blouse, but i would no",3
"I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty, even so, not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...",1
I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering. the neck line fits a little weird. too bad. color was nice though. i returned the top.,1
This is a beautiful color and nice heavier fabric. love the style. armholes not too big. the body is loose fitting at torso but chest area is fitted at 36 c size small . i love this top with skinny jeans or pencil skirt as shown on model. top looks just like it does on model as far as fit.,4
I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th,1
"I had only planned to check out this dress at the store but ended up buying it then and there! not a deal breaker but there were extra threads hanging from some parts of the dress. it made me a bit concern that the stitching would unravel during wear. so far, so good! i wish they had paid more attention to little details like that.",4
"The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.",1
"This dress is amazing. i bought it for an afternoon wedding i'm attending, it's perfect! it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate. the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out. love it in the black!",4
"These pants are beautiful and very comfortable. i am 5'3"" and 120, ordered an extra small. i had to hem them because they are extremely long, otherwise the fit is great.",3
"This is a precious! it's a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!",4
"I purchased this dress in my usual petite size 2. it fit me quite well for the most part, a bit tight around the armpit area but the major issue for me was with the front of the dress. there was a weird pocket of extra fabric under my chest area (i'm small chested). also, the bow across the back did not cover my bra strap (below the bow) which made me think i needed to size up. i'm not sure if that would have fixed the weird fit in the front but i just decided to return the dress in the end. the",2
"This is the perfect pencil skirt! the pattern is flawless!
the top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive! i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top. i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colors.
if you love fall colors this skirt is perfect!!",4
I love this dress. it fits great on curvy girls. the armholes are a bit big (i had to get it altered) but its great. it had two pockets which are great. good length and comfortable fabric.,3
"Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online, however, it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress, highlighting your figure.

i wish this could have worked, however, it felt a little too unshapely.",2
"This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress ""sack"" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats.",4
"Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model, it's a form-fitting style. it's not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i'm not wow-ed by it, but it's nice in a 50's kind of way.",3
This is such a cute top. i like it both off and on the shoulder. easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it.,4
"This jumpsuit is so, so cute. i tried it on in an xs in store but needed a petite. i ordered the xsp online, received it, but honestly it's still a little big. the xxsp is sold out, but i love the piece so much i think i'm going to have it taken in. trust me, it's just as cute as it looks, if not cuter!",3
"I couldn't wait to try this dress on when i first saw it featured. it is stunning! i love the red lace over-layed with a blue slip. it adds a fun color contrast to the piece. i am usually a size 6 in retailer clothing and found this one comfortably true to size. this dress has a very renaissance chic quality which is very feminine, flirty and unique. a great find for fall/winter parties. i can't wait to wear it!

if i had to find a fault with this dress, it's the lack of pockets. retailer d",3
Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.,4
"I have 9.5-10 size feet, and these are a bit small; the heel doesn't quite make it around my heel to where it's supposed to be. still, they're comfy and not too thick or too warm. i really like the stripes of different patterns. good trouser socks. i imagine if you're size 7 or 8 these will fit perfectly. i got the mint and the pink colors, and they're very true to how they appear on my computer screen.",3
"This anorak is perfection! perfect weight, color, and the style is super easy to wear. i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all. i'm 5""3, 130lbs, 32d with an average build/frame and i took a size small. i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater. i think xs would have been too tight in the shoulders/bust. it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape. i got this during the 30% off promo!",4
"This dress is the perfect combo of flattering, comfort, and quality. i purchased the turquoise color, which is vibrant! this will be my go to dress for spring. the material is super soft, flowy and medium weight. i ordered petite s, probably could have got xs. i love, love, love this dress!",4
"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these, but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin, tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short. 

i'm 5' 4"" with a 30"" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on, which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them, i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.

"This dress! the picture doesn't do the dress justice. its so beautiful, well made, and unique. lots of beading and detailing for the price. i'm super happy with my purchase !",4
"I love the style of this top, there's good stretch to the fabric so it's very flattering. the length is good for me, as the previous review stated, it's a little long but for me it's lengthening. the lace is lovely, too. i'll wear it with some white jeans for summer.",4
"I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top, with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.",1
"Just received this and know i will get a lot of enjoyment from it. cute fit and since i have had something similar in the past, i know how versatile it is. nice soft material too!",3
Super comfortable!! i am 34 weeks pregnant and i works great for me now and i think it will be perfect post baby also!,4
These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.,4
"I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.",0
I love this top. i found it to be true to size. i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well. i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and don't show underthings. i bought the navy/black and find that a navy cami works well under it. i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather. this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very,4
"I'm 5'2.5"" and petite and had originally ordered s but decide that it was a bit large for me so i returned it and ordered the xs and it fit like a glove with breathing space. i love the conservative style. i can easily move around in it when i'm in the water with my baby. i don't have a large chest but i imagine this would great for big busted girls. it's lightly padded around the bust area. the skirt detail is very cute and the print is unique. i've already gotten compliments on it.",4
"I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect, straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.",4
"I gave only 4 stars because i really wish the fabric was not so sheer. unless you are very unmodest, you will need to wear a slip. 
i am 6 feet and it hits just above my ankle. slits on side and front. i know it is 'supposed to' be use as a beach cover-up..but forgot that! this is way too pretty not to wear out at night(with a slip {:>). 
i am not a fan of the tie waist, so i at wear a belt to cover it. 
overall, i recommend. enjoy!",3
This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.,2
"Love this top, but the xs is still way too big, swallows me. 5'1"" petite. wish it came in a petite offering. sadly, had to return this item.",3
"I ordered this in the navy and the red/blue plaid. fit- i'm usually a 10 m. after reading reviews, i ordered a l and it was the right choice. it's silky and covers up my postpartum middle nicely. i was worried the pleats would accentuate that part of me, but it does not at all. print- love the plaid. not sure about the navy with diff color dots. that one is probably going back.",4
"I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8"" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.",1
Just got these and they are great..i ordered mine online and took the advice of many reviewers to size down. i usually wear a 27 (sometimes a 26) but got these in a 26 and they are perfect. the material is soft and stretchy. would highly recommend these to all.,4
"I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact, two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however, as we were looking at the items, we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality, as the previous reviewer noted. therefore, none of us purchased the pants.

the staff at the store were very helpful",0
"I found this to be true to size (m fit me well - 5'7"", 140 lb, usually a size m for tops). it does have a straight fit, and it hits at the waist. i wouldn't call it cropped, but if you prefer longer tops you may want to layer. it looks cute with a collared shirt underneath, and you can pull the shirt's cuffs over the sweatshirt. the sleeves were a great length.",3
"I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10, and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.",4
"I bought this in the faded pink rose color (which is inexplicably called ""red motif"") and it is very comfortable yet not so stretchy as to fall off. i did size down from 12 to 10; there is a bit of puckering of the front placket but i believe, based on my history with pilcro, that there will be enough stretching out to even out that puckering. i wish there were pockets though i can see it may be a design decision. i love the faded inbetween color but the other colors are great and i can see gett",3
"I've never bought a jumpsuit and loved this online so i took the chance and ordered it. i'm 5'7 and 130lbs, i bought the small and it fits great. i love the plastic around the neckline to keep the top in place. the draping fabric on the chest is great for my small chest, gives the look of a fuller chest. absolutely love this. great buy and a great price!",4
"Love the design of this denim dress. so unique! i did buy a size larger than i would have normally looked at based on reviews. if on the fence, go up but do get this one. it has no stretch, so a size 8 waist measures 15"" flat, with 17 under the arms. not really for big busted girls. i am 5'8"" and the length is right at lower knee. worth the sale price for sure!!",4
Beautiful in every way. you can never go wrong with black and white. very lightweight since it's not a lined dress so it's perfect for our florida heat.,4
"The shirt fits nice and has a classic cut. i would imagine this to look good on just about anyone. the shirt is soft and comfortable, but is rather thin and see through. the stitching is coming undone a little bit in some areas. wouldn't pay full price for it, but it's worth it on sale.",3
"I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5"".",3
"Saw this on sale and tried it, not expecting anything and wound up loving it. i am 5'4 and it covers my thighs and rear well so i can wear it with leggings. it came mid thigh on me. the red is a rich burnt orange/red. i love that is is mostly cotton so i won;t get overheated.",4
"I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected, and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.",2
"I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed, and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water, the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad, luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned, these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena",2
The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.,0
I bought this sweater to freshen up my fall wardrobe and just love it! adds texture and warmth to every outfit.,4
"The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest, it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.",4
"I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so, i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.",4
"I love my blue dress, i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight, not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!",3
I've been looking for a more polished edgy alternative to my jean jacket and this is perfect! it's super soft and comfortable. will look awesome over a dress or with jeans. love it!,4
I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person. the fabric is light but not too light. it has a nice drape i didn't expect. easy to wear and style. the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest. the length is fantastic as well. wonderful midi length but with the side slits.,4
"I saw this and the ""giddy up"" tees at the store, and it was so difficult to decide because they have their own uniqueness. unlike the giddy up tee, this tee has no embroidery, but saying it has just patterns is underestimating it. the pattern is a work of art, it has cowboys, ranch scenery, cacti, and the earthly colors are gorgeous for all seasons (especially for those who still have a leftover summer tan). the hem of the tee is a bit round which i thought is unique and versatile for tucking in",4
"Beware ladies! these are the first pair of cartonnier pants i've tried that actually run large! i have several other pair of cartonnier crops that are sized way up to a 10 (my normal size is 6 or 8). to my surprise, my normal size 6 in these for perfectly!! the fabric is way different than the printed crops. i got the bright red, and fabric is stretchy! great fit and great weight for summer!",3
"I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding in june. i am 5'4"", 32d and 120lbs. i bought the size 2 and it fit like a glove, didn't even have to wear a bra. the quality is beautiful. the fabric, stitching and detail are top notch and well worth the price. the way the seaming hits you on the hips and but is very flattering, especially for girls who may not be that curvy. it accentuates your curves for sure. it reminds me of an old hollywood, wiggle dress. 

with that being said the dress does h",3
"I was really excited for this sweater, its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.",2
"I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me.",1
This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.,4
I purchased the bird design top for my 17 year old daughter. the fit was true to size and it's a very unique item for casual wear. it looks nicer in person than in the photo.,4
"Super cute. cotton is substantial enough not to show bra lines, but light enough to be summery & breezy. i misread ""xs"" and tried it on, thinking it was a medium, & oddly there's barely any difference among the xs, s, and m sizes--the buttons didn't even buckle out across my bust on the smaller sizes--so, this top could be a nice ego boost if you want to size down (i got the m anyway). armholes not too big, ruffle hides any tummy flaws. great with jeans, shorts, and skirts--like a perfect white",3
"This is a beautiful color top! it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectacular!
i paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked it!
i wish they had other colors!!!!!!",4
The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt isn't heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.,4
"I went back and forth about buying this jumpsuit. very glad that i decided to make the purchase. i wore the jumpsuit to a holiday party and look forward to pairing it with a blazer for work. the material is very soft, yet durable. i wore with flats, but it would be cute with a colorful pair of heels.",4
"I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch.",4
"The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately, these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for",3
"I love, love this wide leg pants! they feel beautiful on and fit like a glove. i do think they run a bit small in the waist, because they were a bit too tight in my regular size. typically, cloths are a little too large in the waist on me (i have a curvy/athletic figure). as other reviewers stated, they pants are long, but they are great length for wedges. otherwise, i would recommend having the length tailored.",3
"I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!",4
"I tried the black cat pattern in the store and it was cute, but the sleeves tend to run quite slim while the bodice is loose. so be aware you may want to size up if you ever have issues with tight sleeves.",3
"After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.",4
"This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted, it may not flare out as much.
also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6, or small-size top/blouse.
in the end, this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.",1
"I received this top in white, last fri., and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn't cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.",4
"I loved this top so much that i ended up purchasing it in another color. it works with so many different outfits, both casual and dressy. it is super comfortable and so soft. i would definitely recommend it!",4
"I love this dress! the beading gives it something special and the petite fits my 5"" frame perfectly. lightweight enough to wear now and again later with layers for fall. very soft fabric!",4
"I absoluty love this dress! it hugs in all the right places, giving a sexy yet very classy look, very much a ""mad men"" look. the quality is fantastic and could easily pass for a vintage dress that has been kept safely preserved. i would recomend every lady has one of these in her closet, especially when you need to feel just a little bit prettier!",4
"This dress is really pretty. i went with the navy, the detail on the bottom is very detailed. it does run very large. i went down two sizes. there is a lot of material and my size made me look like a tent. once i sized down, it was much more flattering and nice. couple details:
the slip is strechable and may have to be fitted if you size down, but you can't see it since it's lose on the outer layer. also, you need a different bra since the cut is cloer to the neck revealing the bra straps. i am",3
"This dress is adorable. it's very comfortable and so flattering. the only thing is i can't understand why it is priced so high. it's a great dress, but i'm just not convinced it's the worth the price tag. i'm going to watch for it to go on sale. fingers crossed!",3
"This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse. the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer. i usually wear a s or xs - the xs was plenty roomy. i'll wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back .the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty. overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans, slacks or skirts. thanks retailer!",4
"I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but, the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft, warm yellow. the fabric is a thin, sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on, i liked the idea, but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin",1
"I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it, for example because it will show through. taking it back.",1
"These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.
i loved the higher rise because they don't feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.
the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.
love the braided styling around the pockets.
the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.",4
"I tried this on (xs) and thought it would be great, butit was simply bog on me and boxy. unfortunately, they are out of petite in the grey color (my favorite of the 3). this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly, but too big was a little too boxy.",4
Take a look at this dress in person or on instagram. the model photos on this website make it look washed out and bridal. irl the lace is a gorgeous ivory tone that looks great casual and dressed up. i'll be wearing this with leather and denim! i chose the smallest of my size range and it fits very comfortably. if you are busty you may want to size up. i am 135# 36c 38/27/35 and i bought size 8.,4
I purchased this dress in black a few months back. i was so excited to see it back in multiple colors! the black dress went well with riding boots and tights for colder temps. the yellow dress will be great in warm temps with cute sandals. super comfortable and flattering.,4
I love this top.the only thing negative is how thin and cheap the material feels.,3
"This dress is extremely feminine. the liner is the unsung hero here: it's cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up, it's a saving grace; it has snap buttons and can be detached, the fabric is opaque so the dress is not see-through. the fabric of the dress is sheer, soft and smooth, and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose. the details of this dress is breathtaking, from the flower design (check out the bottom horizontal lines of t",4
I really like this dress a lot. the material is soft and comfortable. it is clingy but not in a bad way. the design can camouflage some figure problems. i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great. can't say enough about how comfortable this dress is.,4
"I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit. 
will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops.",4
This top is cute for fall. it is a gauzy material and so it's not too warm . it's longer in the back for coverage . fits true to size .,3
"Feminine but not too fussy tee is a nice linen-like material. i got the white one which will go with a lot of my skirts, pants and shorts. unlike other reviewers, i didn't find it too short for me at all, but i am high-waisted. casual but with extras.",3
"Gorgeous and well constructed dress. runs a little small. couldn't button up the size 8 although i can fit into a size 6 of other dresses by this designer. also the back buttons are very difficult to button, especially by yourself. i had to return it but am contemplating ordering it in a size 10.",3
"At first i didn't like the way this skirt hung -- the fabric seemed stiff and it stuck out at the sides where the straight front seam meets the dipped back. but i ran it through a wash and dry, and it softened up and hangs much better! you have to love a polished looking skirt that you can launder with all your other clothes. i am also very pleased that although it looks bulky in the pictures here, it isn't at all, and it doesn't wrinkle - perfect for traveling light. note also that the front pl",4
Versatile and comfy. can be worn with shirts underneath for multi-seasonal wear.,3
"I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually ""natural"" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true",4
"This vest doesn't have a button, so i thought i could put my own. but when it arrived, it just didn't fit that well. the opening in the front is too big, the vest itself while nice and warm is not functional at all due to openings everywhere. i don't know, why even make a vest like this with no front button and such a wide opening, how is one supposed to keep warm at all?",2
"I wanted to love this shirt. it's got a thicker material, a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top. however when i put this on, it just looked like it was ill-fitting over the chest. i think if the pull was below the chest, it would be much better.",2
I bought the dress in mango. i love the color. it is very vibrant. the fit is great and i imagine getting a lot of use out of this dress during the summer months. my only complaint is that i expected the fabric to be a little bit heavier. i find it to be kind of thin.,3
This cardigan was a keeper for me. i love the pin that pulls the two sides together or worn open is just a nice decoration. four starts only because i felt like the arms ran a little short.,3
"I love the colors, and saw the xxs p in a store, so tried it on, but sadly, that was still a lot of fabric on me. i think if you have very small thin arms, that may work, but with muscles, it just made me look bigger than i am... the design (pattern) is really nice though. 115 lbs, 30 dd flat",3
"I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green, hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b",3
This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.,2
"This is definitely a cute top! i am 5'1"" 34a, and bought the extra small. it fits well, very flowy. a little shorter than i like, but it still looks cute. it's thin, but soft and comfortable. i wore it just like the model, with my long jeans and some wedge sandals and it looks great for a spring day!",3
"Nice top. you can dress it up or down. runs very large, i had to exchange sizes twice. my regular top size is 10 but end up buying size 6.",4
"Beautiful colors in this dress that can be worn as a swing dress, belted with the tie, or tied in the back. stunning!",4
"This is my first demin jacket ever as all the ones i ever tried were too stiff, and far too boxy and long on me. i need to thank all the reviewers who helped me take the plunge.
.
got the size xs regular which is only slightly snug at bust when buttoned and a tiny bit long in the arm for me (5'2"", currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and torso). very flattering look. if this jacket comes out in a new darker wash version i will definitely also try a petite size s.

"This blouse is so pretty! i love the design, the material, and the pattern is so unique. i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist. i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less. the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling. i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints!!! i adore it and feel so good wearing it! if i could change anything, i'd m",4
"I bought this shirt yesterday for 30% off the sale price. i usually wear a m. the store only had s and i didn't want to pay for shipping, so i bought the smaller size. it was loose through the body, tight in the arms. you could size down if you need to. but if you have large arms, i would get your normal size or get one larger. the arm fabric does not have much give. the shirt dips low in the front and back, so it has ample coverage for your mid section. it also would accommodate just about any",4
"Super cute, a little buggier than expected but great for layering after the gym.",3
"Unfortunately, this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also, the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.",2
"I have had good luck with cloth and stone and this did not disappoint. i knew i would like it because i have this same top in a long sleeve and sleeveless. it is cute, not too sheer and easy to iron.",4
"Love this blazer - it's a heavy jersey fabric, which is comfortable all day, with no wrinkling. and it has a cute light grey jersey knit trim around the pockets which adds visual interest and keeps it from being a boring navy blazer. the sizing is correct - i wear a 6, and the 6 fits perfectly. it's got a slightly athletic 'boyfriend' fit - it's not boxy, but don't look for a really skinny tight fit around the waste.",4
"I wanted to love this. the color in the picture is pretty true-to-life. the top fit well, if a bit smaller than usual, but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite (5') frame. it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress. the material is very soft, but thin, and is lined, which was a pleasant surprise. sadly, a return for me.",3
This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes,0
"This is an absolutely fabulous skirt. i cant wait to wear it. the biggest challenge is finding the best way to accessorize it. i am an artist and have lots of clothing, but haven't created that ab fab combo yet. i will!!!!",4
"Had to return for a larger size. like the design, though. quality wasn't as expected but since i purchased on sale, i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available.",3
"After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!",0
This dress is flattering and seems to be made well. the polka dots add interest. i am usually a 2 and did go up to a 4 in this. .,4
This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.,1
"Run to purchase this jacket. i am in love. it surpassed my wildest expectations when it arrived. beautiful coloration, comfortable fit, fantastic fabric and gorgeous collar. i am so glad that i ordered it. please use this exact same design and offer this same jacket in other colors and patterns. i can't say enough good things about this item.",4
"As in most ribbed camis, this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.",3
This dress is amazing. bought in orange and fits wonderfully. great quality and could transition in between seasons,4
"I absolutely adore this tunic, however, i followed the label and hand washed/hung dry and it shrunk! i was able to exchange it, so i will be taking it to a dry cleaner to see how it needs to be cleaned.
for reference, i purchased a regular xs...i am 5'2"", 120 lbs.",3
"It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality, like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall, not the dress or quality i expected :/",1
"Size 2p is perfect for me (32a, 25"" waist, and 32"" hip) with a lot of room left for a big dinner. the design is exceptionally creative and attractive, and the fabric is of very high quality.",4
I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres,4
Love the fit of pilcro jeans. it's always a struggle to find a white jean that is flattering around the thighs and doesn't show off lumps and bumps! these are terrific quality indeed.,4
"I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2"" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!",4
"Love this dress! the colors are a smidgen darker than the photo shows, which i like even better. super comfortable, nice flow, great fit. definitely will be a favorite of mine for this summers",4
"The fabric is thin, though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!",4
"I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing, but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.",3
"I thought this was love at first sight. the color and design are both stunning. and it drapes just perfectly over the body without looking like a tent. and the fabric feels nice, but the very first time i put it on, it snagged on my fingernail (and my nails are kept short and neat). this wouldn't have been a problem, except that the snag is very obvious. this material seems like it's going to snag on every single thing. i didn't dare even try on a necklace for this reason. i'm really undecided o",3
"I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer, i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!",4
"I love this caftan! it can be worn belted as a dressier look or unbelted down to the pool or beach as more of a caftan. this is the perfect, versatile piece to have for the summer",4
"I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped ""sweater"" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier.",4
"I have featured photos below. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs and 34 d. i purchased a small petite. the fabric is cotton, i thought it would be rayon. it is lined with cotton fabric. the skirt has major poof. it falls like a midi on a petite. the waist runs high, which can not be a  good thing for a busty gal. why do i love it? the pattern is one of a kind. the colors are so fall. i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look. i can't resist this skirt. if your tall, this is a dream. if your petite, you can",4
Great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day - i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation. for reference i ordered a m and am 130 34b.,3
"The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!",0
"This dress in the blue motif has a really flattering fit and look. the dress especially in this color, hides the belly area well and does not make you look wide if you are heavier in the bottom half. it is not too short and goes past my knee. i am 5'3'.'' the material is also really soft and the dress is easy to pull on.",4
Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!,4
"Like the other reviewers, this is my new favorite tee. it's so freaking soft, and the ribbon down the back just gives a little added flare. pure+good has been one of my staple brands for basics for a while, and i will definitely be buying more colors in this. the length is perfect for leggings, and it would be cute with jeans too.",4
"This dress had a nice silhouette, but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!",2
"All t-la's are great. but this one style is my fave. very comfortable, chic, and washes well! i got the grey, but i'm back to get more colors!",4
"This has a unique style and feel to the fabric which i like. however, the color is not orange as advertised. it's more or a reddish pink tone which was somewhat disappointing because orange is what i was looking for. i will still keep it to pair with other outfits in mind.",3
"I wore this to my retirement party; i wanted something special for a once in a lifetime event. i wanted something that was dressy, while also being unique so i wouldn't look like everyone else. almost without exception, from my boyfriend to everyone i talked with, mentioned my dress. the design is so unique, making me feel even more special on my special day. it's beautiful, yet comfortable. the stretchy sides made it feel snug without pinching or discomfort. really a fun dress to wear. i'm sure",4
"As other reviewers mentioned, this sweater is truly nice in person. i love the different patterns from the fabric. the cut is also flattering, not boxy. the collar on me turend the other way around (dark showing), and it also looked nice. i wasn't planning on buying anything, but it was thanskgiving weekend, with, you know, discount :-# not regretting it...

i will wear it many ways: jeans and tshirt for weekends #if i get out of my workout clothes#, but also could be worn over a nice black blou",4
"With the pleats, probably need to tuck in shirt. these were too big for me, so need to return.",3
"I bought a petite medium and the length was right, but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable, and didn't look completely terrible from the front, but from the side, it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing, but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.",1
"Bought this in navy - going to buy another one in a different color!  it fits my curves beautifully!  does not look ""boxy"" like other tunic sweaters.  i also disagree with other reviews, i cannot see through it.",4
"This is a very flattering blouse, but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size, so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton, gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on, but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer, and because of the lightness of the fabric, it does not app",4
I was looking for a new pair of pajama pants/around-the-house pants/occasional-quick-errand pants to replace a pair that i bought from retailer six years ago and i fell in love with the look of these.they are truly comfy and are flattering on. the lace adds a nice feminine touch that makes me feel pretty even on my laziest days. i'm hoping these will last me another six years.,4
"Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.",0
"I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it's nothing like the red color shown, rather it's a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested, it is very thin and runs large. i have to return.",0
Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,0
"I love so much about it... it really is a gorgeous piece!  i just cannot get over the shorter sleeve... there's something about it that makes me feel like it looks as though i bought it too small, or shrunk it in the dryer =0  i'm the only one commenting on that, so it must be me. lol. i think i'm going to begrudgingly return this one :(",2
"This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.",4
"I have received several compliments when wearing this sweater. perfect to dress up or dress down. purchased it in black and red. does run on large. i am 5'3"" roughly 110 lbs ordered an xs.",4
"I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else.",4
I did not find this blouse to be tight in the arms or chest. (i'm a 34a though so maybe that is why?) i also don't have a problem with it being too short in front. i took my usual size 0. i like the feel of the fabric and the prints are great. the only thing i slightly dislike is the flowy bottom of the shirt. i wish it was more fitted and that is why i took one star off. i got the cat print. the cat faces are white and on random faces there are pink ears or a pink nose.or a winking eye - just a,3
"I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. 

my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.",4
"Love this and wish it came in more colors. the fabric and cut are so comfortable. i bought my usual size and was a little sad to see that it shrunk just a touch in the wash. washed and then air dried but put in dryer for 15 mins to speed up drying process. i'm 5'7"" so it's already short but now i'll probably just have to wear it as a cover up or loungewear around the house. super cute though and great price with sale on sale!",4
Love this sweater it's perfect for chilly florida evenings....love the loose boxy shape and it's very cozy not itchy!,4
"I love these jeans ~ the are so soft, so comfortable, nice fabric weight...not too heavy or stiff at all, very flattering, best of all they move with you, but do not completely stretch out by the end of the day ~ i am on retailer site now to purchase another color~",4
"This is such a great piece. throw this top on with a pair of skinnies and some booties and you're dressed. it walks the line between too tight and too loose beautifully for my figure. love the contrast lining. it washes beautifully (i hang to dry). i wore it twice the first week i owned it. size s was best for me. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and generally a size 6.",4
This top is sold out in my size online but i was fortunate enough to snag one in the store. great top that can be dressed up or down. the ruching across the front is very slimming. tried the top with skirts and pants -- looks great with everything! i usually wear a size small in deletta tops but sized up to a medium to accommodate my chest (i am a full c cup). i highly recommend this purchase.,4
"I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person
if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it.",2
"I got this in an xs as the s sold out before i could purchase. i can still zip it at 27.5/28"" but would be more comfortable at say 26"". i'm almost 5'5"" and with 3"" heels it skims the floor perfectly. i'm so obsessed with the weight and texture! it is full and fabulous! i'll just need to slim down a tad so i can be comfortable at my sister-in-laws wedding next month. 
i wore a very fitted tank and it works perfectly! photographs well and feels very red carpet worthy.",4
"Great coat! lightweight, oversized, yet warm. just enough structure to flatter most body types. i wear an xl/14, but got medium as it's very oversized. light enough to wear with layers. got a million compliments!",3
Love these pants. the color is a true red and they are very flattering on. i ordered the 6 but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing. just reordered the size 4.,4
Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer. the lining however is not silk it's rayon and sat weird on me. it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless (i do have a large bust). i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will i'm keeping the dress. the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture.,4
Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.,4
"This is a very sweet/soft sweater, however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!",2
"I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo",0
"First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small, which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close, on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru, but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.",2
"The colors are amazing. so vibrant and plentiful. the arm holes are fairly generous but not bad. i think it just adds to the loose fitting nature of the dress. i got a medium.. i'm 170 with a small chest. medium is my norm for maeve. the buttons in the back are difficult, you need help getting on, but getting off you can do solo. this dress makes your shoulders look really good!! it sits in a very flattering way.",4
"Got this dress for a party.  it was a last minute purchase and i was nervous if it would fit.  it not only fit, it looks great and is very comfortable.  have to love an a-line skirt and a top with short sleeves.  it covers everything while looking sexy.  and i didn't have to spend a second worrying if something was showing that shouldn't be.  got compliments all night.  i got it in red and black but went with the red based on feedback from husband and bff.  buy it now.  its perfect for holiday p",4
"This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit, but not as a layering piece.",2
"This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.",3
"I'm 5'4"" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel",4
"This sweater is huge! i usually wear a small, ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it. i like big sweaters, but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous.",2
"I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color.",3
"This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals, but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos, the dress is baggy and empire waisted, and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie, and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy, such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.

anyhow, i wanted to share photos of the real",2
"The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.",3
Love this top. a little heavy but looks great with shorts or white jeans.,3
"It's hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first. 1. yes, it runs big and wide but not long, which i like. 2. yes it it is fairly sheer, but the design allows for a fitted tank. 3. i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected. it's a cute late summer top, easy breathing for humidity. 
i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap, so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out. it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh",4
"I love this sweater coat! the buttons make it more structured and practical when the weather is cool.
the colors are even nicer in person; the neutral yellow is sure to compliment a lot.
you would be disappointed with this purchase.",4
"I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san",4
"Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on, i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also, although this wasn't a con for me, the shirt is darker than appears online.",2
Cute blouse & great price !!,3
"This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size, but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty, but background is more of a muddy gray, then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available, i'd have exchanged it, but it is going back.",1
"Debated for a while about this dress...love the flower embroidery but i was worried the nude colored top would look drab on. it actually looks nice on my skin (tan-ish, yellow toned), surprisingly. however, there is a noticeable amount of extra room in the waist (i have a 24'' waist. it wrinkles a bit in that area when i move around. i'm not sure if that's a deal breaker or not...i guess now i have even more to debate about. the length is a tiny bit longer on me than on the model #5'0'', 100 lbs",3
"I didn't like the price tag, but got a good price with a sale, so i splurged! this skirt hugs curves in the nicest, most flattering way without feeling like you have to hold in your belly:) very cute ruched design and soft make it easily dressed up or down. i plan to wear with some bright flats for an upcoming trip, but have the perfect white tennies for casual everyday. love it!!",4
"I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.",1
"Can't say enough about the style of this trench, the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types. the color is great and there's some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coat.

the sizing is a little hmmm. i ordered a large. i'm usually a 12 on top or a large, mostly to accommodate a larger chest (ddd i think). proportion wise i'm more a medium through the shoulders and in length, so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shape.

with",4
"Super cute on.  i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable.    the slip is a tad tight, but it doesn't bother me, its stretchy so it's not uncomfortable.  i bought size xs-i usually wear a 2 in dresses.  i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about 2"" above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didn't need the petite.  i am 5'3"", 125 lbs.  i loved the soft fabric-fine for year round in southern cal.",4
"These run a tiny bit large, but i'm still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable!",4
"These pants are simply darling! i purchased them with my birthday discount (thank you, retailer!) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny. flattering, and the most important feature of any pant, makes my butt look good. don't hesitate, buy these today before they are out of stock. 

the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality.",4
"Love this dress, it's comfortable
and it can be worn casualties or formally.",4
"This is a very nice top, but it is very loose and swingy indeed. i sized down one size, and it still is very relaxes. the material is soft, the colors are nice.",3
"I am quite happy with this dress! i was wondering what the colors would look like in person, and i'm happy to report that the skirt is a nice mellow orange-coral. beautiful detail in the patterns used here, and i always like a dress that has great color-play close up and far away. for reference, i am a size 16, full figured, with a 40 c bust, and the size 16 was just right for me. sometimes with maeve dresses you can size down, but there is no stretch to the dress, or the slip, so that is someth",4
Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body,4
I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan,2
"Sadly, i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest, so sizing up was not necessary, but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!",2
The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!,3
"I cannot say enough good things about this dress. as a petite person (5'0), it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations, but this dress fit perfectly. it's also so well-made: the fabric is soft, comfortable, and gorgeously detailed, and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume (in a good, flattering way)! i got it shortened by about 2"", but this dress fits like a dream.",4
Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.,0
"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!",4
"Soft, comfortable, flattering, versatile--what more can you ask for? just wish it came in a long-sleeved version.",4
"Two strikes against this top, and its going back. first, the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact, since i have tanks i could have worn, but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price, i wouldn't have expected b",2
"I love this shirt so much!!! i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color. this shirt is soft, true to size, comfortable and extremely flattering. it is one of my new favorite go-to shirts. retailer - great job at finding a stylish, casual top that can take me through all the seasons.",4
"I just received these jeans today after buying them online last week. i wasn't sure how they would fit, but i am so very happy i got them. and on sale too!! i am 5'2"" and about 128 pounds. athletic and curvy but petite too. i bought the size 4 and they are a perfect fit in the length too. they are button up, boyfriend style but not too baggy. the detail on the cuff is perfect and they have a unique, unusual but expensive look. what a steal !! i would have paid full price for jeans that fit this",4

i am 5'7"" with a 34c bust.....i have this dress in a size 4 and it fits very well. this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist. the dress length hits me at the lower calf, just like the model online. i think the armholes are cut a little high...this being said; this dress would",4
I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.,4
"This dress looked amazing in the picture. i am 5'10 and since the model was 5'9 with the dress dragging on the ground, i assumed it would be long on me as well. even with flats, this dress is an awkward length. the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great. it just doesn't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length.",2
"I'm glad i saw this item in stores, otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp, and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!",4
"This top is so cute on. would look great on anyone as the style, quality, and color is incredible. highly recommend, even at this price. you won't regret it.",4
"The embroidery is actually navy blue, not black like it shows in the photos, which was even better for me. these are so soft and feminine looking. love love love! please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer :)",4
"I loved the multi stripe pattern, buttons, pockets and a-line shape .  i agree it runs small. i sized up from my normal size 4 to size 6.  it sits at my belly button which i like.  i can tuck in a thin shirt comfortably.  the pockets kind of sag/pooch forward and don't lie straight through the course of the day but not enough to really bother me.  i  straighten the skirt by pulling up.  great buy on sale. i'm 5'2"", 115#.",3
"I agree with the other reviewer, this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give, a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up, usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.",4
"Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so, i have bought 3 new pairs, and all have been so disappointing. first of all, the quality is horrible now. in the past, they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also, pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened, pilcro?!?!?",1
"This trench coat solves my eternal problem with trench coats - which is that when i see one on a model in an ad they look effortless and casual, but then when i try one on it looks rigid and stuffy somehow. this trench coat drapes beautifully. that said, it's not the same kind of fabric as a traditional trench coat so it probably isn't water resistant. i'm fine with that, it looks amazing.",4
"Nice fit, wish it was a little longer but i really do like it and feel good when i wear it",4
"Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo",4
"So i love this top. i got it in black and red. both are amazing and go with about anything. they run a bit large. i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck. i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry. i would say it shrunk 10% at most. beyond that, no difference. in fact, it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big. obviously, if you do not dry clean this, you are going against manufacturer recommendations, but i",4
"This is a beautiful summer dress. i especially love the exposed back which is the perfect cut to not show your bra and feels professional enough for work. plus it's comfortable, drapes nicely, and is machine wash and dry.",4
I love this dress! it is equally pretty in person too. sometimes i will order things and when i get them the colors are totally different than what i anticipated. not with this dress. i love it and will get a lot of use out of it over the spring/summer.,4
"This top does sit weird, feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down, probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.",2
"I ordered this top in xs and blue, its subtle but pretty on, as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance, is not uncomfortable, just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top, want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.",3
"I ordered a size small. i am 5'7"" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high, so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft, thick, stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.",0
"I'm a 32-a, and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight, but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back, it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it, but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.
the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work, because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.",2
"Great, rather heavyweight, long cardi. i purchased the blue, which is a lovely shade of gray/blue, not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater, but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5"", 136 lbs, 34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model.",4
"This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other, giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.",2
"I love these pants! i got the blue ones. i got a petite 25 and i am 115lbs 5.1.5' - they sit low on waste and hug curves just right. they are little bit long, maybe 1 inch too long. will wear with platform or thick squared heel.",3
"Love this dress. very comfortable and stylish. wanted my size. but they only had a size larger available. still bought it, but feel good in it. glad i purchased it.",3
"This is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day. cotton enhanced with beautiful detail. a very classic timeless, ageless piece. i bought the medium, which fits perfectly (size 8 top, 34f). my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep; there is a gap. funny thing is that, in the photo, the model's blouse is pinned exactly where i'm talking about. i didn't take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem, but this was annoying. i wore",4
"Retailer has great designs but sometimes they use cheap fabrics and are not quality made. this top is quality made and super soft. its a little thicker than a normal cotton t-shirt but thinner than a sweatshirt. i normally wear medium (34dd, 135-140 lbs, 5'4"") and this was tts. i got the blue and its a little bit darker in person. one big plus imo is that you can put it in washer and dryer, no need to line dry! i am going to buy the natural colored stripes one too. also, i bought the normal size.",4
"I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8"" and weigh 145 pounds with an approximate 10"" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!",4
If you're looking for a great day to night shirt this is it. perfect transition from the office to happy hour,3
"Love these shorts! not too tight and not too short! they match so many tops! tts for my hard to fit figure! great for weekends, vacations, and just to be adorable in!",4
This is the perfect dress to wear casual or dress up a bit - perfect for fall and super comfy!,4
"I purchased the blue color and it's gorgeous. i'm 5'7"" and the length is perfect, not too billowy and not too tight. the fabric is a nice gauzy, summer weight.",4
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.,0
"Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l",0
"I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist, i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl",2
"This coat is a classic! i would wear it every day if it wasn't so distinct. very comfortable, flattering, and stylish.",4
"I ordered the red color way, and the bird print is very cute. that said, it is cut a-line and not like a regular button down. through i found it tts and good quality, it was shorter than i would have liked. this exaggerated the a-line shape. i didn't completely dislike it, but i didn't love it either.",2
"This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.",0
Love this top. beautiful. received a lot of compliments.,4
I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.,1
"Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.",1
"While i do love this sweater, it did not fit me as is pictured. the wrap does not lay as smooth and i had to adjust frequently when transitioning from a sitting to standing position. nice weight.",4
"I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair, the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong, but those were even worse. they looked obscene.",0
I really liked this tank. i purchased it in the green. i went with my regular size 2. yes it's boxy but it's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer. i'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft.,4
"I really feel in love with the details of these joggers and they did not fail me when they arrived. i haven't worn them yet but tried them on and they seem like nice little relaxed wear with a tee shirt. i can see them being worn with a cami in warm weather or a relaxed tee shirt in a variety of colors. all in all , very versatile , and i recommend them.",3
"This dress is wonderful. wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed, lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across, and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection, making it look super-tiny. the design is simple but very clever--it's feminine, flattering, and slimming. my only quibble is that it's quite long (and i'm almost 5'7"" in my stocking feet)...i will have to wear heels or have it hemmed. highly recommend.",4
I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.,3
Love this top-that simple,4
"Tried on & bought in-store. so cute & flattering; the picture doesn't do it justice. great neutral piece (more beige than ivory in person). looks cute tied or untied. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs and the regular size s fit perfectly (not too snug, not too loose, and just long enough to cover my bum.)",3
The dress has some cute features. the little belt motif hits too high on me and the drop waist is a little awkward. but it is comfortable and looks best with some kind of shirt worn underneath,3
"I loved the look and feel of this shirt the moment i saw it. it would be so versatile with jeans, skirts, and black slacks. i was contemplating wearing it with a tulle skirt for nye but it wasn't meant to be. usually my issue with these tops is in the bust and strangely that wasn't the case this time. this is great news!! also they made the sides adjustable so wide hips are not a problem either. however i have muscular arms and well cloth and stone are not thinking about that. they make the uppe",2
"This sweater is more stunning in person then on the site. i saw it on the internet previous to seeing in the store. i purchased it right away, it was love at first sight!!. the detail on the collar is beautiful, and reminds me of the unique sweaters i have have in my closet from retailer from years ago that i still love. get it before it's gone!!!!",4
"I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.",2
"I love this dress. i bought this dress in both a m and a s. i was worried about how ""loose"" the dress would fit and also how short it would be. the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was 5'10"" but not what size dress she was wearing. i am 5'11"" and am in between a dress size 2 or 4. the medium was way too wide, but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow. i purchased the green/slate color, which is more green and has very faint stripes. very",4
"I was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews. but it intrigued me- especially with the sale price! i love it! i am 5' 6"" and got the small. it hits just at/below my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back. it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings. what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side. a beautiful touch! the neck is very high- almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look. i l",4
"I am super-pleased with this cardigan, which is at a terrific sale price. i saw this in the pink color in the state street retailer in chicago, and i loved the feel of the material but wasn't sure about the color for me. when i saw they had a neutral striped version online, i decided to get it. the material is very soft and the beige/neutral color has a gray undertone which is good for my skintone. the front is double-layered and it has a fun seaming detail in the back and an ""unfinished"" trim whi",4
This too is great to throw on when running to class or going out. love the two different materials and the back detail.,3
"This top is perfect! i'm 5'9"" and a medium build, and it's hard to find tops that have long enough sleeves. this is really long! i love the weight of the fabric - perfect under a coat and heavy enough for cool texas winter days. the fabric is really soft and the color is a blue-ish grey. the style is feminine but not too girlie. it's my new go to top!!",4
The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how,2
This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.,1
I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. it's very cute and on trend. can't wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!,4
"I saw this gorgeous blouse in a store over dark blue jeans on feb. 19. of course, the store stock only went up to a size 12. typical. with the way the 12 fit, i knew i had to size up from my usual size 14, and i did. i ordered it in a size 16, and it arrived on monday, feb. 22 -- with lightening-fast speed. it is breathtaking and fits wonderfully. i like the top button undone, the buttons are gorgeous, and the blouse is very retro, circa 1973, but you definitely have to go up one size. the only",3
"I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it's perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes, big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it's really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score!",3
"I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,

i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.

i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.

"I wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night. it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming! i got a petite 4, and it fit perfectly. for reference. i am 5'2 and 125 lbs. you ill not regret buying this dress!",4
I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,4
I am in love with this top! it is so comfortable and lovely. it runs a touch big like most items of this brand.,4
"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",1
Absolutely love this skirt. it is well made and fits as normal. i love the fact that it can be dressed up or down.,4
Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.,2
Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.,1
"I bought this on sale in all 3 colors. it doesn't look like much in the photos, but that's really the point. this is a staple, basic piece. layer on colors and prints, like a printed jacket, scarf or bag. i bought this in wine, along with the sweater knit boots and a bag with a print that ties the colors together. the shape of this dress is great - fitted through the waist and not a lot of extra fabric in the skirt. midi is usually a bad length for me 5'2"" but since the skirt isn't overwhelming,",4
"I love the look of this dress when it's on. the only issue i have with it is that the inside of the dress is white, which shows through on the chest slightly, but it's such a pretty dress and such an overall great fit, that i'm keeping it anyway!",4
"I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.",4
"I found this dress delightful! i have worn it numerous times and though quite long (for some girls) fits me well. my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast. the fabric is light and comfortable, i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing. i am 5'9"", 155 lbs and a 34a cup; i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well.",4
Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.,4
"I love it! it's cute and short and shows off my legs. the material is thick and great quality, so great for the fall. the color is great for florida!!! brightness year round. it's fits perfectly. i purchased a 14 and it fits like a glove. i am going to wear with my booties and a jacket like the model. hey it works!!!",4
"They're great. i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails. they looked comfortable and cute, different with the leg warmer type bottom. i went to the retailer near me, but they didn't have them in store. this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes. but, i ordered them because they were affordable, in the $30 range, cute, comfortable, and stylish. they also ended up fitting perfectly as well. nice job!",4
"I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse, the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version, be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!",2
"This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd, and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person, as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback, which depends on your taste, is the yellow pattern - it's a weird kind of greeny yellow",4
"This beautiful, soft, swingy, dress is oversized on me.  usually when someone reviews that a dress runs large but their body type is opposite mine, i pick tts and 90% of the time i'm right.  not so in this case. the outer dress is very wide and the amazing super stretchy under slip is too large also.  debating on sizing down because of potential shrinkage after laundering.  i bought m and my stats are 5'3"" 140# 39/28/35.  dress ends just above my knees.

"I purchased this in the gold in-store. when i got home and saw it also came in turquoise, i ordered those right away as well. the fit is amazing. the pants are very slimming without being tight. they are a comfortable and flattering pant. i really love the colors and will probably snag another pair or two when able. these are a great pant to dress up or just look snappy casual in. they are a great versatile pant. i normally wear a size 8 and weight 155. the 29 fit perfectly.",4
"I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the 4 worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.

the quality is excellent, the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so",4
"The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely, and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer, but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes, i would probably size up.",4
"Disappointed :-(
this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.",1
"Bought the green/blue - colors are bright, fabric is so soft. the neckline is just right for a small chest. the top is structured nicely, giving you a figure flattering fit.",4
I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!,4
"Just bought red today to wear to a conference to stay warm over floreat peasant blouse and pilcro serif jeans. love love!! very flattering and plan to wear with skirts, on airplanes for warmth and for travel. very versatile . highly recommend .",4
"The color of this cardigan is beautiful, and the material is very soft.",3
"The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.",1
I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint. i purchased the blue and love it. i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small.,4
"This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this, but it just doesn't fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...",2
"I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared, but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf, skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!",4
"I was looking for an off-the-shoulder top and chose this one. it is pretty. the bottom of the shirt is fairly billowy, so i can only wear with skinny pants. takes a little getting use, somewhat restricting my arm movement so the shirt pops off my upper arms.",3
"Very high quality fabric and the fit is excellent. the skirt is stylish yet simple and very easy to wear as i feel i would have no trouble paring it with several different tops. it can easily be dressed up or down and is excellent for work. i got this on sale and am so glad, still, it is one of the few items actually worth the initial high price tag. great quality!",4
"I ordered this dress with the 25% off everything code as it is a bit expensive. i will say it is well worth the price. from the material, to the design, and fit, i was truly pleased. i am usually a 4p in retailer dresses so i went with the xs-p and it fits perfectly. it is super cute and unique, and i love, love, love the pockets, which is always an added bonus. it is so fun and flattering, as i am sure people will be asking where this one is from. a definite summer must have. obsessed with this w",4
"This dress is really pretty, but not made for girls with hips. i tried on my usual size 6 and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable, but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an 8 (typical of shifts i guess, but a girls can dream!). if you are a straighter shape, though, i would highly recommend.",3
This is so awesome. i love how it fits. it's great quality. it's flattering. it's casual but put together. love. fits true to size. i bought it in white as well.,4
"Product is sheer, but definitely adorable w/ any jean product! wouldn't pay full price but so glad i got it on sale w/ extra savings!!!",3
"This is a great alternative to a vest. it does have some blue in it, as the other review mentions. i gave it less of a rating due to the potential for snags. i am keeping it though for the sale price!",4
I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i don't want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it's the right shape to flow gently. it's just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it's flattering. not sure if it will fla,4
"Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.",0
"I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.",4
"I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium, which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes.",4
"I thought these would be nice, and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also, the jewels make the jeans feel heavier. 
fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans, slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer, as not only am i short, but i have short legs for my shortness!)

so if you want that styl",2
"Great shirt, the material is lightweight without being see through. i didn't find the cut to be all that flattering, but it was a cute enough style and comfortable enough that i wanted to keep it. definitely see it becoming a staple in my closet.",4
"I bought this item in green and then ordered it in red. very comfortable fabric and flattering by itself or over leggings. these tunics will be staple in my closet. i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but i ordered a small to have it a bit more fitted instead of baggy. good decision!",4
"Easy, fun and flattering. fits tts. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i ordered a large and it fits well. the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it. the length is good for my 5'9 frame.",4
"This is the most flattering dress i have bought in years. the fact that it's machine washable was a huge plus. fabric is so comfortable and the length is perfect! i wear either m or l and went with the large for a little extra room, but either would have fit well.",4
Very unique shirt-- you will get a compliment! the material has a great feel and weight. beautiful color. it runs true to size.,4
"I bought the white in a m, one size down from my normal. i could have gone with a s, given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen. it is very light and comfortable. the length is a tunic on me, at 5'6"", so keep that in mind. if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure. i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes. i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two. if they get black or grey i will def. buy another one.",4
"This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have 
a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material
 like cotton versus polyester, but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice.",4
"Best ""jeggings"" ever! they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings. soft but substantial fabric, nice dark gray, worn in color.",4
"I originally bought this tunic in black, and loved it so much i bought the rose as well. normally tunics make me look like a box, but the tie on this one makes it super flattering.",4
"A must have 1 piece. every time i wear this i get compliments! it's very flattering, amazing quality, soft material, good support and vibrant colors! i wish this came in more colors and patterns. worth the money no questions asked!",4
"I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red,for it doesn't compare to the black one.i would have loved it,if it was a red dress with white flowers.i didn't like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!",3
"Love these pants. the perfect cuffed crop pant for the summer. lightweight, cool, and comfortable. fun pocket details. i typically wear a 26 and bought a 2 in these. within a short time, they were slipping a bit low on the waist. that's my only frustration. they are a loose fitting pant but they shouldn't slip off the waist. perhaps a 0 would fit better. these weren't in my local store (an hour away), so i ordered online. perhaps i'll try ordering another color in both the 0 and 2. i would sugge",3
"The top is indeed a bit boxier than i was expecting, as the other reviewer found. it still looks good tucked in if you're concerned about it. the fact that it's sustainably produced in ghana was a big part of my desire to keep it too. really great to see designers producing clothing responsibly! i wish that how a garment is manufactured is highlighted more on this site because it definitely contributes to my purchases.",3
Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.,4
"I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large, or something? ! i ordered an xs, my usual size, xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose, the upper arms are a bit snug, and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place, but when you look at the model, it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received, and another reviewer, the seam was puffy, making for a strange look. in theory, the shirt should have worked, but didn't. i loved the pattern, not the fit.",1
"I love the way these jeans look and fit, but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them, but it doesn't seem to have helped.",1
Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors. very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this. i wish retailer would have more pieces like this. a+,4
"These tights are so cute, but the sizing leaves much to be desired. i guess they are true to size since they are labeled s/m.

i'm 5'0"" with shorter legs than torso, and i suppose i'm lucky that i have muscular (read: large) quads/thighs to suck up some of the fabric, otherwise these might have just bunched up at my ankles.

the other thing i don't love about them is the feel of the fabric - it's more sweater-like (and not a soft sweater) than stretchy. maybe that was the intent, but i find tigh",3
"If you like looking like a giant square and hide things this is the way to go. for me, it completely irradiates my shape, including my neck. this will be returned.",2
Size 0 ordered .they fit beautifully for the first 2 hours but slowly stretched out and lost their shape sadly.,3
"I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.",0
"I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!

beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the ""red"", thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however, the ""red"" tee is actually a light orange color. the ""orange"" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.

i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color, because i really do love the quality of this shirt!",4
This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit,1
"I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!",4
This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.,4
"Love this top for work. loose, flattering and enough detail to be noticed. fits tts and goes with everything.",4
"I was hesitent to order this, was worried it would be too shapeless. i'm glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent. the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin. it is lined. i had no issues with the bust (i'm 38c). i wish it were an inch longer (i'm 5'9).",4
"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.",4
Finally a dress that is not too short! i'm 5'11 and ordered two sizes. the small was too short and a little snug for my liking. but the medium was a perfect fit.,4
"This is a really cute and flattering dress on me. i am 5'4"" 120 lbs and the 4 is a perfect fit. i am a little busty but the empire seam brings the dress back in slightly below my chest so it does not tent out.the asymmetrical hem makes it really flowy when you walk. the under dress is a lightweight fabric in a sheath cut that is shorter than the over dress which is a fun detail. the over dress material is somewhat gauzy and it moves as you move. the pockets are positioned in the front which is a",4
"I bought the blue dress, though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.

i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge), but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller. 

i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual, which is what i wanted, but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty.",2
"I love these pants! typically, i have a difficult time finding pants that fit my smaller waist and curvier hips and legs, but these fit well enough. all i need to do it have the waist tailored and they will be perfect. the pants are also soft. the only downside, and it is not a deal breaker for me, is that they run a little large and seem to stretch out a bit with wear. considering this, i would downsize one size.",3
"I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.",4
"So glad i bought this!! its beautiful and being on sale made it even better. good quality and versatile, highly recommend.",4
This is not your basic white tee. the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest. cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace.,4
"As soon as i tried on this cardigan i knew i had to have it. it takes your outfit to a glam and high end look. the fabric is oh so soft and i loved how it draped. the sleeves hang low and give you a vintage feel. i would give this a 5 star rating however, the downside to this cardigan is the shedding! it shed all over my black pants when i wore it, and on my friends too! :( i really went back and forth on returning this, but i think it's so beautiful i am keeping it. i am hoping over time the sh",3
"This dress has a beautiful fit--5'4"", 150 lbs, 34ddd, and the medium regular fit great. the only issue is that the bottom part of the dress wrinkles terribly. when i bought it, the woman folded it nicely, and i stashed it in my car for the rest of my shopping trip. when i arrived home and pulled it out, the bottom of the dress was horribly wrinkled. plus it's dry clean only. going back. :(",3
"As another reviewer pointed out, although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water, the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover, or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.",1
"This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug, but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over, anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise, the top is great and perfect for summer.",3
I'm 5 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering.  however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!!,4
"I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store. it has my favorite colors in it. blue and orange. as one reviewer said, the print is eye-catching. the feel of the material is soft. i am 5' tall so it fits on me like a dress, although if you are a taller person, the slits on the side may be higher on the frame. this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now.",4
"This is a wonderful dress. i love the fit and feel of the fabric. i have been looking for a while for a 'fall' maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased. this dress is perfect with them. the colors are fall and fresh, can i say that about fall?",4
"I'm 5'7"", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.",0
"Colors are much brighter in person, fits well (not frumpy like a lot of open-front sweaters). colors make it perfect for neutrals but maybe hard to mix with other colors. pricey, so still considering whether to keep it.",4
"As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist, i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short, too wide in the hips, and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.",1
I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i wasn't totally sold on colors looking online. well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both. this shirts are great.,4
"This blouse is basically a rectangular piece of fabric that is folded over and sewn up the sides. the side seams are about 2-3 inches in from the edge of the fabric. the neck opening is finished nicely. the fabric has a nice drape to it, but the design on the front isn't as crisp and clear as i thought it would be; the design is a bit fuzzy. so i wish the picture on the front were clearer. i always wear an xl in retailer tops, but the size l in this fit nicely in the bust except is too snug at the",3

"I am 5'4"" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron",4
"Soft, lightweight, comfortable. i wore this as soon as i got it and have received many compliments on the style and color. super soft, love the angled zipper and sleeve length is long enough to be comfortable. great cool weather jacket.",4
This shirt is simply pretty. it's light and dresses up a distressed pair of jeans.,4

"I was afraid the twist at the front would be too bulky, but it adds a nice extra touch to an otherwise simple shirt. i got it in the blue and the color is beautiful. a basic piece with a little bit more; very happy",4
I'm either a medium or large in retailer tops. i was able to wear a medium in this top. the color is vibrant and the material is soft and light. it will be a great spring and summer top. can't wait to wear it.,4
"Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small, and they have a funny smell.",0
This shirt is like the best worn in flannel with a little feminine flair! super soft and great length.,4
"This is a beautiful sweater/tunic/dress. i ordered in the mustard color, and wearing it will brighten my day on a dreary winter morning. it is so hard to find winter clothes in bright colors. the sweater is soft and not itchy. it is a bit longer than i expected...maybe 35"" (i am 5'7""), but that is just fine! it can be worn with leggings or tights. dressed up or dressed down. i couldn't be more pleased.",4
"I am a brand loyal ag fan. best washes, best pocket placement and these are no exception. they do run a little big. i usually wear a 26 or 27 in the stilts depending on the fabric content. i tried these in the 26 and 25. both fit, but i went with the 25 because these will stretch at least 1/2 size. the distressing is the right amount, however i gave 4 stars because one area is directly over the knee which i don't care for. solved it by having a seamstress reinforce the back of it with a similar",4
"This dress fits well and the material allows for hiding lumps and bumps. material is heavy, yet soft. i could see wearing it with sneakers as the model is, or dressing it up with jewelry and heels. this will be a perfect dress to take on vacation, as it won't get wrinkled and it is so versatile. i'm normally a size 4-8 depending on clothing item, and i bought this in a size small. fits perfect. for reference, i am 38-26-38.",4
"I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing, when i tied the strap, the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on, it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.",1
"Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back, and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.",2
I wasn't sure how the fabric would be since i ordered it online but i wasn't disappointed. its got a lot of movement which makes it really comfortable while still being cute. it's a little longer than i anticipated but i don't mind that. it just gives it a little more versatility. also it has pockets!! i love pockets so maybe i'm a little biased.,4
"Super flattering cut and the material is like buttah! no seriously, it's like a 10-yr old tee soft! the colors aren't even close compared to online, though. the green is a brighter almost grass green and the pink is more like a salmon color. i didn't see the lilac in the store.",4

"I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.",4
"Purchased the petite size of these jeans and the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height. the description doesn't mention what length the petite size is but i believe it to be 31 inches. the jean is cut small in the hips and snug in the thighs so consider going up a size if you are curvy. great color and style. i may be 60 something but these jeans bring me back to my youth. love them.",4
These are beautiful and very comfy. they do run very large. i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small. the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results. the description needs to be updated to reflect this.,3

"These pants are a heavier twill than the pilcro chinos i bought from retailer earlier this year. these weightier wide leg trousers have a perfect drape. my size is between a petite 26 and a petite 27. the size petite 26 fit me well so i judge them to be a 1/2 size large. 
if i had written the review before washing them i would have given an overall rating of 5 stars. after washing once in cold water detergent and regular wash, the color lost a lot of blue. the color went from a wonderful fresh/sp",3
I have this dress in white and i have worn it twice for completely different events. i wore it with red heels for a dressy look and then with boots and a jean jacket for a more casual look. i am only 5'4'' and it hit above my knees. it's a soft white that is appropriate for winter wear. love it!,4

Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!,4

it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works",2

"I ordered this online in red. i would definitely say this color is more of an orange-red. i like the weight and the cut. i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is. the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress.

"I tried these on in the store and instantly fell in love with them - they have an elastic waist which for my shape (pear) can sometimes be bad, but these pants don't cut me off or accentuate the ""fluffy"" parts, but lay nice over my belly and legs in a flattering way. they do have a slit that goes the whole way up the leg, that the picture doesn't show, but the underneath piece of fabric wraps around your legs, so i think it would be hard to show too much. i bought a medium and they hit lower on",4
"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!",4
For reference i am 5'3 121 lbs and i usually wear a size 6 or 8. i got a size small and it was still at bit large. my bf said it was a nice dress to wear around the house ( like a house dress). a bit pricey for that but the way it hangs it does look like a house dress or a bit like a sack. i kept it only because i was looking for casual dresses. i wore it out and got a few compliments ( prob cuz i never wear dresses). good luck.,3
Love love this skirt! such a pretty green color and a great quality. this will be a staple in my closet for years to come. and i love a skirt with pockets.,4
This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,2
"I am a true size 6 in virtually everything, pants or dress. i was swimming in these! i am reordering a size 2, they were so big.",4
"Received this jacket yesterday...and it is lovely.
very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.
the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online, was slightly disappointed with that, but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no ""oh she is wearing that jacket again""....
the forest green is rich and elegant.
the fit is true to size, but this is not a fitted jacket, it falls more straight, but the peplum is a gorgeous accent. 
a classic with impeccable quality!",4
I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it's slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it's not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it's comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great.,3
"First, let me start out by giving a reference. i am 5'1"", 138lbs, 34dd, 30, 38. i usually take a size 8 in maeve, esp if there is no give. i bought a regular size 6. 

first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips. 

the bad: surprisingly, the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f",2
Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.,0
"I tried on this top in the ivory color in the store, but i didn't need another ivory-colored top, so i passed it up. however, i kept thinking about the pretty details, especially trim on the sleeves, so when i saw it online in the red color, i ordered it. i was surprised when it arrived with how thin and sheer the fabric is (the soft flowy mini-pleated body of the shirt; the other sections are flat cotton, which is more sturdy). i hadn't noticed this when i tried on the ivory version! but i'm ke",3
"Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned, it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft. i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra, i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry, but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist ...it is perfect! many compliments & the hem is so fun...also other reviews mentioned the bow",4
"This top did not look at all like it did on the model. i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose. great for someone who is pregnant. which i am not.
returning.",2
"These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p, but they were sold out in the gray color, so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big, at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well.",4
This sweater coat is really cute and soft (i hate itchy sweaters). the blue is lovely and the cut is flattering. i'm going to check it out in other colors as well!,4
"Love this shirt, bought this shirt, returning this shirt. believe this and the other reviewers who say it runs small, especially through the bust, and even if you're not busty. it's now sold out in my size, wish i'd gotten a bigger size that i could keep!",3
"Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o",4
Ordered the navy and aqua in medium. the aqua fit a lot tighter than the navy seemed to be a different fabric and less stretchy. loved the color on both but returning the the aqua. normally wear size 6,3
"I am a petite girl, 5'2""/105 lbs- i bought size s and it fits me just right. i love the way the fabric feels on my body. i tried this dress with flat shoe and it doesn't make me look short. the colors are vibrant but not too bright which makes it perfect for any time of the year to wear.",4
Love this piece. it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a t-shirt. i look forward to wearing it often.,4
"This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't",4
"High quality, soft, thick fabric that drapes well, keeps you warm, and figure flattering. i'm 5'4 and the length is perfect. the color is a great neutral that goes well with everything. love the design detail throughout. this cardigan does not have a button or tie closure so if you are between sizes, go with the smaller size for a tailored fit.",4
"Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don't have an occasion to wear this).

length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.

color is very nice, overall sexy dress.

material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)",4
"I love this cover-up. it does feel big when you first put it on, however, you just pull on the strap and tie it to your liking. i am 5'2, so this hits a little lower than on the model in the picture, but it does not drag on the floor. this is my new favorite cover-up. now, all i need is the sun!",3
"I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color, pattern, slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.",4
This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.,2
"This is a great every day dress. the buttons in the back make it very figure flattering, and i love the long sleeves. the fabric is light, so i'll definitely be wearing with leggings.

it's a little tight in the shoulders, which is pretty standard for this brand for me.",4
"I really love the feel of the fabric on this dress. when you first take it from the package it resembles a tent, but once you figure out how to scrunch the front and back around the straps, it resembles the photo. the fabric is very soft and the indigo colors are amazing. this dress is perfect over a swimsuit or for casual gatherings. you can even dress it up with a belt. it is somewhat sheer, but does look cute with a cropped jacked over it.",3
I thought this would be a great dress for late summer early fall and i was right. it's light and flowy but the colors are darker. it's very cute and i can't wait to wear it with nice boots like in the picture.,3
"Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat, even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!",2
I love this jacket! it is stylish and is ideal for a casual night out,4
"The blue is a beautiful color, rather unique and it is really soft being cashmere. although, for the price i do feel it should of been a bit more ""special"". i also feel it's loose lower half feels a bit maternity. all that being said i do like the overall sweater and am keeping it as the color and feel win.",3
"Note: the inseam runs a little longer than stated above. if you are truly a 29"" inseam, you may want to get the petite size. i purchased the petite small, my inseam is 27"", and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet. however, the length can be changed depending on where you wear/place them on your hip.
i've worn these trousers at home and around town with ease. they are a wonderful cold weather, go-to wardrobe staple. i wear a nylon trouser ""slip"" with them to prolong the need for cleaning",4
This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.,4
"I agree with a prior reviewer who stated this seems overpriced - it is. it's very lightweight and not quite the quality i would expect for the price (the washing instructions tag was sewn in all crooked - really?). i ordered the black as i was hoping to wear this to a dressy (though not formal) event but i am not sure it works on me. i think it would be a really fun summer dress option in either of the 2 colors (the blue looks really pretty online).

it is very cute but definitely runs large.",3

These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.,4
"I'm a rather small person--5'2"", about 100 lbs, 32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place, i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs, planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee, but even as petite as i am, i coul",1
"I don't care because i like be it so much; but, make no mistake, it is not black but rather a dark navy. however please don't let this fall negatively on your decision to buy it. it's fabulous!",4
"This was a last minute addition to my online order to hit the free shipping! anyway... this ended up being my favorite item from my order! i love the way it wraps and also lays open. i didn't realize that the fabric was a mix of two different knits, but i think it adds nice interest. i ordered the red,which is a nice, deep red...not an obnoxious fire engine red. it's very complimentary to my skin tone and dark hair. i run between a small and medium, but chose the medium since it looked like it c",4
"This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear, though.",1
"Really cute casual dress. wore it to a ""girls night"" out!! they all loved it. can't wait to wear it again with knee high boots!",4
"I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing.  it's lined and tts.  i usually wear a size 4 and this fit well.  some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good 2 inches in length.  i'm 5'3"" and 119# and it hit me just above the knee.  i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi & kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt.  it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have",4
"Lovely print and colors. interior lining was so super soft, but it did lay right on me, felt very big and bulkly and i wasn't a fan of the single snap closure, esp being so low, so i decided it was not for me at that price and returned. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the s was too big. it is beautiful and i will consider the xs if the price is cut further.",3
"Found this randomly in the store (online return) and didn't expect to like it but tried it on and fell in love with it. extremely comfortable dress, but also has a unique/special design that makes you feel great wearing it. will be perfect to wear out when don't want to look too dressed up or like trying too hard.",4
"This dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees. the material is nice- not flimsy. i'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite, straight frame. the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless. i've never worn a shirt dress so i'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to look? i tried it with a belt but it doesn't seem to work with this dress as there's a band of loose elastic. probably would look better on a curvier bod",3
Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love,4
"Very pretty and comfortable. it was not obvious at my store that this was to go with swim suits. it was located next to regular pants, but once i tried it on - i realized it was somewhat see through. i still got it as its very lovely. i'm going on a beach vacation, so i know i'll use it over bathing suits. honestly i may use it with nude underwear or long shirts anyway, since its so different and pretty. i bought a large as i'm a 10-12 and its still pretty loose.",4
"This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.",0
"I like design of the dress, softness and color ( i got grey), the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6"" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.",2
"Beautiful. got several compliments when wearing it. does not hold up with washes though. threads unraveling everywhere. i am thinking of returning it for this reason. fits true to size. i am 5'4"" 118 lbs, xs fit. i am smaller on top.",2
"I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.",4
From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it. the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful. it is even prettier in person than it is online!!,4
"I just bought these last week and have had a hard time wearing anything else! they are super comfortable, with great pockets. very flattering and wash up great. wish they made more colors...",4
"The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.",1
"Beautiful detail. sweater is warm, soft, and very comfortable. fits perfectly. i was worried without having seen it in person that the lace detailing would be fragile, but it is knitted into the underlying sweater material. i have worn it no less than five times already and not a flaw or a pull in it.",4
"This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look ""thick"". highly recommend!",4
This is an awesome go to for dressy or casual! wore it with booties for a dinner and flats for temple and was perfect for both! lace is a little delicate but worth the extra care!,4
"This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b",4
"This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.",4
"Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3"" 140# 36dd.",4
"Soft  stretch denim, 70's fun vibe . i so wanted to keep this , but for me the sizing was off. i ordered a size 27, my usual denim jeans size . the waist down fit perfectly but i couldn't zip the top portion. i fear that even if i order one size up which i believe would still be ok for the bottom half ; i still won't have enough room from my rib cage to the top of the bib section. i had  a 3 inch gap  in that area

Many complements today at work! comfortable even on days you don't want to wear something form fitting,4
Very trendy and very cute. i love how it fits perfectly without being too tiny on the backside. the material is a bit flimsy for the price.,3
"I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.",3
I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.,2
Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.,2

"I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store. the blue is more of a gray, but it's a great color. i tried on the small and my daughter said ""you look pretty, mommy."" i was sold! i love the cascade on the side.",4
"But like other reviewers said, it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs, i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material, it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this, but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed, because the material is beautiful and i lo",1
"As others mentioned, love the little buttons, and the cut is flattering. i ordered the ""denim' one (multicolor). i didn't end up keeping it but will order again if goes to sale. likes: colors are fun, material is soft, buttons are beautiful, cut is decently flattering. what i didn't love is it looks wrinkled.

i ordered the xxs and xsp - only tried on xxs as i didn't think i would keep it anyway, but thinking of it, is should have still tried the xsp. arms were almost snug on me (i lift weight",3

will exchange for smaller size since i think it would be really great if fit properly.",3
"This is my 4th pair of these printed cords and they are beautiful- the color says navy but these are definitely black with a grayish print. very stretchy all over except for the waist band which is a little uncomfortable but it might loosen up some. i wish the rise on these was a little higher. also worth noting is that the design on larger sizes won't look exactly like the picture- my size 33's have the floral scroll print up the front and the back, but also the cut has the scroll print running",3
"I had my eye on this for a while, and my store finally got it in (in tmie for the 40% off sweaters). too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then, however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way. i wil lnever know about petite, decided to jsut purchase as is (they don't have xxs either#. the fit is on hte looser comfortable side. the red color is rich, and the design is subtle, adn will nto fall apart, so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover. will look nice with j",4
"So, i really like this sweater, as you'd expect for this price point, it's stylish in a very single way. so glad i read the review before mine to size down. the xs is great and i wouldn't want bigger. i love the length: how it goes long and cones in a little at the bottom, and the pockets are higher(i always need pockets for my phone). the stripes are well draped as the sweater transitions from shoulder to arm. the cuffs are fun, too. 
bottom line:  i'm really glad this came on sale and i snatc",4
The front of this top is pretty thin and you can see through it,4
"I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on, but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress, which i think is nice, no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about, but it ties the dress together nicely.
the front pocket is different, but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before",4
"Hands down, my new favorite top! love the look of this top! i would say this runs a little big. i definitely could have sized down. however, the flowy style of my usual retailer size works for me in this piece.",4
"I knew i would love this dress, it looked so me !
my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful
i was expecting 3/4 sleeves, these were to the bottom of my wrist. i could have been fine with that but, the entire dress was so big on me. it looked like a sack. i usually wear a sz 4, or s/m this was a small. will return.
if you can find one that fits i would recommend it.",2
"I have a sillier style sweater from moth that i got last year and love. this is not as great, but i like the style so i will keep it. i knew the sleeves would be shorter, but wish they were made full length with a little less ""bat wing"". the color is close to as shown- maybe a little lighter. i was hoping for more of a navy since that is what they are calling it- but this is more of a denim blue.",3
From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.,4
I bought this top in black n moss. they are of a great quality n love that u don't need a cami under. i do like them very much except that they're a lil too billowy in front for me. when i gathered excess material on the sides it looked much better. the black didn't look as large...black is slimming. i love the neck and the material. haven't decided yet if i'm keeping or returning.,2
This is a super cute jumpsuit that is also super comfortable. the only thing i wish was different on this jumpsuit is that the pants would go all the way to the ground. but it is still super cute and a keeper !,4
"I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it, but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash, it would help it. after washing, it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt, but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.",2
"I purchased this in the red & love the fabric and overall design of the top. i have returned it for a larger size. it is very small through the chest. hopefully, a larger size will give me more room though the chest without being too large in the rest of the shirt. i'm a 34 c and ordered a size 6 for reference.",3
"I'm not sure what cup size i am, 36b or 36c, but the medium fits perfect. material is soft and stretchy. i usually wear a medium size shirt. i definitely won't be wearing it out in public, but i like it a lot for at home wear. the matching underwear may run large. i'm usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops, but the medium worked for those too.",4
Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer!,2
"This dress is so cute and comfortable! it can be dressed up or down, super versatile. love it!",4
"So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti",1
"This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back...",0
I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.,3
"I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color, which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.",3
"This is a cute top but the sleeves are super long.  they swallowed up my entire hand when i put my arms down to the side.  i also found it to run slightly large.  i ordered my usual medium and i had too much room under the armpits.  the sleeves weren't as fitted as the model shot either, which i would of preferred.  i probably could of shortened the sleeves, but didn't think this style top fit me so i sent it back.  this does not require a cami underneath.",3
"Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause, but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c, 65"", 135 and the small is perfect.",4
"This skirt manages to be both sophisticated and whimsical. it's well-made, classy, feminine, and timeless. love it!",4

"I originally bought this for myself but it was way too big on my backside since i don't have much ""junk in the trunk."" i decided to pass it on to my sister since it was just too pretty to return. it fits her much better and she's worn it on a few occasions. it does run larger and the pants are very long. definitely have to be either hemmed or always worn with heels.",3
"Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes, the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i",2
"These are just perfect, exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months.",4
"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.

an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.

the fabric is quite beautifu",0

"Can't say enough about this cute dress....i bought it in red/ which is more of a burgundy, and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots. i can see wearing this in the spring, summer; heck, all year round! quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch. don't pass this one up!",4
"I wanted these jeans so badly! i originally ordered them in my regular size -a 27. they were too big even for a tomboy fit, so i ordered a 26. the size 26 order was backordered and then cancelled. i am so sad! i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size. they are so soft and beautiful. i love ag's quality.",4
"Wow! great find and a true fit. i totally dislike pant shopping and these are a gem.
slimming, flattering and so comfortable, the style is great. great basic summer pant!",4
"I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.",0
"These shorts are a must. they are so soft and go with every top imaginable. i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts. for reference i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24,25, or 0. you will not regret this purchase.",4
"I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia, where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable. the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldn't necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites. these pants can also go to the pool, out on errands and to brunch. i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige. great find and very reasonable sale price!",4
"Wonderful fit - love that these have a bit of texture to them and the structure is perfect. easy to wear with ankle boots or flats, and thick enough that you don't have to worry about see-through incidents. the only issue that i have is that the elastic in the waistband isn't secured, so it tends to twist around - just a minor annoyance and wouldnt stop me from ordering these in another color!",3
This dress is exactly what i needed.  it's so easily dressed up or down.  heels and jewelry for cocktail this time.,4
"This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!",0
"I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy, poor quality for the price.",0
Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with,4
"Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey, like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so, it doesn't look at all grey irl.

i'm still recommending because, if you get the right size, and like the colors, it will be a nice, light and comfy swea",1
I thought this shirt was really interesting online and it doesn't disappoint in person. i love the uniqueness of the shirt but wish the quality of the white fabric was a little higher. overall though this was a great find and i know i'll wear it again and again.,3
"I love this suit, and have gotten so many compliments on it. i weigh 106-108 lbs. and ordered a s. typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up. the coloring is beautiful. the legs are high cut / flattering. the top has no padding, and shows a seamless result. highly recommend!",4
Love!! so comfy! i wish they came in more colors. i'd order every one!!,4
"Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist",4
I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.,4
This top is delicate and so feminine. it is beautiful. does run small. i had to size up. i'm usually a 6-8 m and had to buy l. it has no stretch.  so i needed room for movement.,4
"I was excited to find this on sale because i just love baily 44, their designs are always simple, beautiful, and comfortable, and this one, just like the other 2 baily 44 dresses i own is perfect. i am 5'9, 125 pounds, and 34b bra size and got my usual size, xs. unlike my other baily 44 dresses, this one has a more relaxed fit up top and then has a form fitting layer that shows off your curves on the bottom. i personally don't think it's too short, but then again plan to wear tights with this pi",3
"The quality and design of this top is great and it goes well with my skinny jeans and wide-leg linen trousers. only thing is that it does need to air dry or i imagine it will shrink up which would not be good for taller frames. i'm slim, 5'8"" and got an xs and it fits just right. the carbon color appears to have hints of blue/purple on screen, but it's actually a plain dark gray.",3
"I love these bottoms. great colors. i also love the feel of the bottoms, very soft. high quality.",4
"Beautiful blouse - my only complaint is that the lace is too open for my taste. i'm a size small or a 4 for the most part. in retailer i can sometimes wear an xs. i decided to keep the small. yes, it's slightly restricting but i don't notice it much - it's definitely not a straight jacket. i also ordered a medium and in a way it could have worked but there was a lot of extra fabric. i am not flat chested - i wear a 34c - 32d depending on the bra. if you are inbetween sizes like me go with the larg",3
"I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it, so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress, which is good for spring, but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you, the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.",2
Love this tank. fits true to size & looks great with jeans or shorts. a bit disappointing that the back does not have the lace like the front (only on the top back).,3
"I'm short, only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it's just below my knees and i think it's perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment, and asking where i got it. it's unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love, that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that's what i love about retailerpolog",4
"If it's a knock off, its of the ""poise"" dress, and a pretty good one at that. this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it. when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why. the erin fetherston dress is over $100 more and they look just about the same. i'd rather have the $ and the look!",4
"This is an understated elegant denim dress. the fabric color is just the right fade and thickness (not too thin and not too thick) which is appropriate for most occasions. it?s very soft and can get a bit wrinkly but nothing major. my local retailer has only the regular size and it's true to size, size 6 (my usual size for holding horses brand) fit well around the bust and waist area (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips; busty gals may want to size up). this dress shows cleavage so if you?re conscious like",4
Very comfortable and easy to dress up or down. i get tons of complaints on this dress- it's a definite win!,4
This top is very cute and is made out of soft material that isn't clingy at all. and you don't have to be stick thin for it to look good. i don't like to show my arms normally but this top is very flattering all around. i love it!,4
I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use. you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool. i bought it in 2 colors and may go back for more. i wish i would have found them sooner.,4
"I was looking for a pair of ankle jeans to wear with booties. i love my regular length paige hoxton jeans but they are too long me (5'4"" 120) if i want to wear booties. i decided to try the petite size and.... perfecto!!! just the right length and the rest of the fit was just like my other paige jeans. i love when you can count on sizing to stay true across styles.",4
"I'm so happy to add this lovely and unusual dress to my fall wardrobe. i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. i wear a two or four, depending on the designer, and the two fit me perfectly. another reviewer said it's special occasion only, but i like it so much, i'll wear it more often. with that said, it's a wonderful go-to dress for the holiday season.",4
It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady,1
"I was hesitant to buy but this tee is easy, light, and fun to wear.  the fabric is light but not see through in the slightest.  the construction is perfect.  it is tts for an oversized tee.",4
"I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl. i've gotten such good use out of it. the fit on me matches the model. the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch. not your typical hoodie. but, just the same comfort. i've washed in cold in my machine & air dried. it hasn't shrunk. one of my favorite purchases. perfect for chilly weather or when you go into a/c areas. would love this in other colors. great piece!",4
Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.,4
"I tried these on in the store in the small and needed to xs, so i ordered them online. they are perfect! i wore them last night and got so many compliments. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 125 lbs.",4
"I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.",3
"I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:
__________
pros:
- pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.
- the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course, i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.
- runs ""mostly"" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i",3
"I agree with the other reviewer, the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all. the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks. i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything. i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome. very versatile and flattering.",4
"I'm 5-months pregnant and wanted some beautiful tunics to mix it up between the usual maternity wear. this top is lovely! i love the cut, length and embroidered details however i am not a fan of the side slits. this will work much better post partum so i plan to keep it but my belly currently pulls the slits a bit awkward.",3
"This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.",4
I really liked this dress. i agree with the others that say the side seam comes up pretty high. i think i'd wear as a tunic or open like the model. i can't justify full price though. tts. my normal med fit.,4
"I ordered this in large since it was the last one available. i normally wear a med, but i do enjoy the oversize look in silhouettes like this one. the armholes are very low, but since i have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) this does not bother me one bit. i'll just wear a super lightweight tank underneath for coverage/protection. also, the oversize fit allows me to wear a long sleeve for layering if i desire. i love the flow and fluidity of the material and will be wearing this one a lot.",4
"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!",4
"Everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd.  i have an oddly shaped body, so this dress was perfect on me!  the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body, skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasn't too twee.  the silhouette evens out my odd figure.  the fabric is a gorgeous pink/orange/teal pattern on comfortable cotton.  i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline, it's a bit immodest.  i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la",4
