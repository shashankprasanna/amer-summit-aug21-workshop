#### Workshop Overview
**Workshop duration: 2 hours**

**Abstract:** Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled significant breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing (NLP). With state-of-the-art ML models, you can perform a range of NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, and more. In this 2-hour, fully remote technical workshop, AWS experts walk you through step-by-step instructions on how to use Amazon SageMaker and Hugging Face to build, train, tune, and deploy ML models at scale.

**At the end of this workshop you will be able to:**

* Easily fine-tune or train NLP models from scratch on text data using Amazon SageMaker and HuggingFace library integration.

* Accelerate ML development and optimize training cost by leveraging Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks, fully-managed training instances and managed spot training

* Apply the steps learnt in the workshop on your own datasets for NLP usecases such as text classification, text summarization Q&A, and others
